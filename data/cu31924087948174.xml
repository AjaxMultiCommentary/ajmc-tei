						<p type="title" n="114-117">PREFACE TO VOL. II.</p>
						<p type="preface" n="118-382">THIS volume was in preparation, when I was called upon to produce a second edition of Vol. I. The delay thus occa- sioned has given me the opportunity of comparing my notes, in revising them, with those of Professor Paley upon the same four plays, Ajax, Electra, Trachiniae, Philoctetes. It is reassuring to find that one who has lived with the Greek Tragic writers so intimately and for so long, agrees in upholding the general soundness of the traditional text of Sophocles, and in rejecting many recent alterations. There has seemed to be a danger lest the brilliant adventures of Bentley and Porson in ‘conjectural criticism might lead their successors to extend the so-called art beyond the narrow limits which are prescribed for it by the nature of language and the laws of probability. But the considerate judgment, which rarely forsook those great men, and is the best part of our inheritance from them, remains amongst their country- men, and sometimes refuses to be imposed upon by fancies which assume the garb of logic. Professor Paley has spoken of the previous portion of my work in terms which are deeply gratifying to me, as coming from a scholar of his experience: he has also made continual reference to the small edition, by Mr. Evelyn Abbott and myself, of the plays contained in this volume, especially of the Ajax, Electra, and Trachiniae. Although his manner of doing so is always friendly, yet it has not made me a convert to the practice of referring frequently to other commentators in explanatory notes. For (1) as Mr. Abbott’s</p>

						<p type="preface" n="385-740">name is omitted, I sometimes reap credit that is due to him; (2) I do not feel that we are always clearly repre- sented; and (3) I am often prompted to repeat (mutatis ni- tandis) the words of Professor Conington, in the Preface to his edition of the Choëphoroe, published in the year 1857. Professor Conington there says, ‘To prevent misconception, I may mention, that my notes on the first half of the play were communicated to Mr. Paley while he was preparing his last edition. Unfortunately they were in a very imperfect state, a considerable portion of them only existing in a first draft; and this has led him to notice as mine, various opinions which I have long since discarded. I trust, therefore, that Professor Paley will not think me discourteous or ungrateful, if I refer to his edition only where I have felt bound either to acknowledge an obligation, or to give a reason for dissent. In one respect Professor Paley has thought fit to deviate from the conservative method,’ which he has for the most part consistently followed. On grounds which appear to me far from convincing, he has sometimes assumed the inter- polation, not of words merely, but of whole lines, and even of several consecutive lines, where this had not been pre- viously suspected. Thus in the Philoctetes he brackets L 1431; in the Electra, II. 201, 690-5, 1379 foll.; in the Ajax, Il. 855, 966-71, 994, 5; in addition to at least an equal number of places, which Dindorf and others had previously condemned. Such excision may often be a tempting way of avoiding difficulties and removing inequalities. But the difficulties can be otherwise accounted for; and inequalities in dramatic writing are not always blemishes, or if they are clearly such, may be referred to hasty composition. The dialogue between Teucer and the generals in the Ajax has by many been thought unworthy of the earlier scenes; and in my own judgment, the lines uttered by the deified He- racles ἀπὸ τῆς μηχανῆς, are incomparably less impressive than the first speech of Philoctetes. But (I) we have been pre-</p>

						<p type="preface" n="743-1095">pared for such anomalies' by the criticism of Longinus; (2) we must not expect equal care to be spent on every part even of a work of Sophocles; and (3) in seeking to dis- criminate between the work, say, of Sophocles and Iophon, we are not only proceeding on a mere assumption, but are attempting a task which is beyond the reach of criticism. Undoubted interpolations in Sophocles are not numerous, and consist (1) of glosses which have crept into the text, (2) of lines, probably genuine, which have been first written in the margin as parallel passages, and then have been treated as if they had dropped out of the context; (3) of spurious additions. To the first class (1) belong the rejected words in O. T. 1265; O. C. 1747; Ant. 628, 1344; EL 856; Trach. 840; Phil. 679. To the second cause, or one very similar, (2) may certainly be referred the addition of καὶ μάνθανον τὸν θυμὸν ἐκδραμόντα μοι after O. C. 769, the repetition of αὖθις ὧδ’ ἔρημος ἄπορος, O. C. 1716, and probably also the rejected words in Aj. 554, 714, Phil. 671-3. The third class (3) may again be divided into two ; spurious additions may either have been made (a) by a scribe who wanted to fill up a real or supposed lacuna, or (5) may have been gratuitously invented. The interpolations which may reasonably be as- signed to the former cause (a) are Aj. 1417, Trach. 80, Phil. 1407, 8. There remain only two passages () to be con- sidered here, viz. Aj. 839-42, Phil. 1365-7. These cannot be accounted for in either of the two former ways (1), (2), and yet they appear to be self-condemned; in the one case by the confusion of Agamemnon’s fate with that of Odysseus, and in the other by the irrelevant allusion to a fact which the speaker cannot be supposed to know. In these two places, therefore, ve must admit that the text has been per- versely tampered with. But before extending our admission to other passages, we must have equally cogent reasons for doing so1.</p>

						<p type="preface" n="1494-1804">in editing the Fragments, I have availed myself of Mr. R. Ellis' acute remarks on them in the Cambridge Journal of Philology, Vol. IV, and that I am largely indebted, as every editor must now be, to the edition of the Tragic Fragments by A. Nauck, Leipzig, 1856. I had once hoped, as indicated in a former writing, to give here some general account of previous editions of Sophocles. Further reflection has induced me to relinquish that project. To have executed it on any considerable scale would have unduly burdened a work which is already sufficiently loaded. To assign to Aldus, Canter, Turnebus, Camerarius, H. Stephanus, Capperonier, Vauvillers, Brunck, Musgrave, Erfurdt, Hermann, Elmsley, Schneidewin, and a host of names only less distinguished than these, each his own proper share of merit and of blame, would be, indeed, a work demanding high qualities, and not uaworthy of any scholar’s ambition. But for myself, I feel compelled to decline it. It may be well, however, to indicate once more in outline the history of the text. Aldus (Venice, 1502) seems to have depended on the Venetian MSS. 1, the most legible of which, 467 (V3), is very closely akin to Paris A. The first Juntine edition (Florence, 1522, editor Antonius Francinus) follows closely on the Aldine traces; but the editor of the second Juntine, who is said to have been Victo- rius, appears to have had access to L; and the Roman edition of the Scholia (A. D. 1618) was taken either from this or a kindred MS. The next important edition, that of Turnebus (Paris, 1558), is memorable for the importance attributed by its editor to Paris T, the Parisian copy of the recension of Triclinius, with his Scholia on the metres, etc. This new influence continued through Stephanus (1568), Canter (1579); Capperonier and Vauvillers, and the London editions, until Brunck (Stras-</p>

						<p type="preface" n="2137-2460">I have been extremely sparing in the adoption of conjectures into the text of the plays; but in editing the Fragments I have been less severe. Before this course is accused of inconsistency, let it be considered (1) that quotations are specially liable to error, (2) that the text of Athenaeus, and of other writers in whom many of the Fragments are found, is acknowledged to be very far from certain, and (3) that the evidences of corruption are frequent and in- disputable. I have here to repeat, with somewhat more of emphasis than in the first edition of Vol. I, that the signs C3, C4, Coò, etc., which are necessarily retained from my first collation of L, have merely an approximate value. That C32, and C, the διορθωτής and the Scholiast of L, are one and the same, was Diibner’s opinion, and is probably correct. This hand, whether in cursive or quasi-uncial characters, may be dis- tinguished from that of the scribe of the Sophocles by a still greater delicacy of touch. If so much is correct, it follows that the marginal Scholia, throughout the volume, were written after the several parts of which it is composed were brought together into one; for C2 appears on the margin both of the Aeschylus and the Apollonius, e. g— Aesch. Suppl. 518 (the whole line in marg., by C3). Aesch. Suppl. 575 (κραίνων in marg. C3). Apollon. Rhod. 1. 848, τόν ῥα καλεσσαμένη διεπέφραδεν ὑψιπύλεια, add in marg. C2. It would be well if some competent inquirer could ascertain whether the corrections noted as by C6, C7, which may be roughly described as hands of the fifteenth century, were made before or after the removal of the MS. from the East into Italy. (See Vol. I. Preface, p. xli.) I may here remedy an omission by mentioning that the bracketed numbers [81 a, etc.], on the margin of this edition, denote the pagination of L.</p>

In all the cases given above, except one or two which are specified, O has preserved the correct reading, and almost invariably sides with L against A. A few of O’s minor corrections of A are omitted ; e. g. in accent as 495. τῶνδέ τοι; 628. μεθεῖσά μοι, where A omits the acute accent: 779. δεί’ O. w A: 890. ubpav O. μωρὰν A: 1433. Bare O. Bdre A: 1497. πᾶσ’ O. πάσ’ A. These illustrate the minute accuracy of O. 3. From this list of readings it is plain that O is a more correct MS. than A, and a fairer representative of the family of MSS. to which A belongs. The list of differences just given, in almost all of which O corrects A’s errors, clearly shows A’s tendency to in- terpolation, and hence at the same time it follows that these omissions and corruptions do not belong to A’s family, but have crept into one branch of it at an era of the text later than that of O’s original. The many places where the text of A omits a word or is corrupt, but where O supplies the omission and confirms L and the correct text, show that O certainly represents the text of an earlier date than A, when it was still pure from many corruptions and errors which A has gathered. 4. Certain corruptions are common to both O and A, and must have crept into the text of this family of the MSS. at a date con- siderably anterior to that of A. The following is a list of all the errors common to O and A, which can be properly called errors of A’s family2. A very few minor divergencies of accent and orthography are omitted.</p>

						<p type="preface" n="6592-6901">of this family of MSS., which is thus shown to be far less faulty and interpolated than has been generally supposed. The list of errors common to O and A (or it may perhaps be said, the entire . number of errors occurring in O) is seen to be not larger than that of errors occurring in L. O is, I believe, one of the most correct MSS. of Sophocles. iii. This MS. belongs to the fourteenth century, but its text is exceedingly pure. It shows no trace whatever of mixed readings, nor yet of a corrector’s hand, apart from the old errors which it shares with A. In no passage where the text is uncertain does it present a reading which first makes its appearance in MSS. of the fourteenth century: EL 1469 is the nearest to this, yet all editors adopt this reading, and we may presume it to be ancient. Instead of coming down by a succession of intervening copies, each with its quota of errors and interpolations which have crept gra- dually into the text from the margin or from between the lines, O must have been copied directly, or almost so, from a MS. earlier (perhaps considerably earlier) than A (see § 3). Thus its text (that is, the text of the MS. it is copied from) may be really older than that of A, and the authority of O, a fourteenth century MS., deserves in some respects to be greater than that of A, a thirteenth century one. May not some other fourteenth century MS. prove to be valuable and throw light on the text, as being a direct copy from some ancient original? This, if not probable, is possible. At all events O disproves the statement recently made1, that "the variants of all other MSS.’ besides L and A are ‘of no value.’</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="7771-8292">Hector by Achilles before death, which Euripides also assumes, has in all probability an Epic origin1; but Sophocles is fairly to be credited with making Ajax perfom his last act in presence of the Sun, and not, as Pindar describes it, at dead of night, or as Arctinus (according to the Scholiast on Pind. Isthm. 3. 59), in the grey dawn. It is more important to notice, what is evident on the surface of the play, that for dramatic purposes the poet sets forth the same action from various points of view. How far any of these rest upon tradition, how far upon invention, is again doubtful, though we are naturally tempted to assign what is crude to primitive legend, and to Sophocles what is noblest and most refined. Thus the incident of Ajax’ slaughter of the cattle could not have been referred to the invention of Sophocles, even if we had not been told that it was included in the Little Iliad. 1. The interposition of Athena supplies the mainspring of the story. Her appearance in the opening scene produces a deep impression, which remains with the spectator to the end. Although dimly visible, and not blazoned to the view, as she would have been in an Aeschylean drama, her voice must have thrilled the vast audience with a no less overpowering awe. In the course of the drama her action is differently regarded by different persons. a. She comes at the height of that which mortals deem her wrath : — but what calmness, what sublime self-possession, breathes in every word ! We see that she has done nothing but in care for the army and for Odysseus, whose wisdom, inspired by her, preserves the army. In maddening Ajax, she has saved the generals, from whom she has brushed away the impending danger, ‘ as a mother flicks a fly from her sleeping child,’ and in the defeat which caused his rage and made her interference necessary, he suffered the inevitable consequence of his overweening pride. Her face is still against him— that the spec- tator sees—and her divine irony is terrible. The gods know no half- measures ; they are as inexorable ‘ as a law of Nature.’ But we are made to feel that without this act of her displeasure the host must have perished, and the severe warning to Odysseus with which she withdraws to the unseen Olympus, justifies her in the mind of the spectator of all suspicion of vindictiveness and party spirit. She her- self draws from Odysseus the admission that Ajax, when in his right mind, was distinguished both for bravery and foresight. b. Not so does Tecmessa in her bitter grief read the lesson of the situation.—‘The terrible daughter of Zeus has contrived this calamity to please Odysseus.’ Not so does Ajax understand it in his rage. He only knows that she has defeated his purpose :—‘ The resistless goddess of the petrifying glance, daughter of Zeus, foiled me with madness when in the act of stretching forth my hand against them.’ In his dissembling speech he professes himself anxious to avoid her</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="8318-8771">anger. But when alone at last, he passes her over in silence, appeal- ing to Zeus, the supreme god, to right him as a kinsman, and to the Erinyes to avenge him against the Atreidae, on whom he throws all the blame. c. Yet another way of viewing the divine action appears in the reported speech of Calchas, which makes the crisis of the drama. Athena’s ‘wrath’ which Ajax has earned by his pride, is irresistible while it lasts, but in the eternal counsels it is not destined to endure. Thus we are assured that although the attempt to save the hero’s life is doomed to failure, he is no longer to be the object of heavenly anger, and Odysseus, in vindicating for his enemy the honours of a chieftain, is carrying out the unanimous wil of the gods. To this he has indeed been predisposed by the warning which he re- ceived from Athena in the opening scene. In all this it is manifest how the spirit of Attic tragedy has softened the old crude notion of divine malice,—the hard saying that Odysseus she had loved, but Ajax she had hated.’ 2. The interest of the tragic poet, however, is less concentrated on the supernatural background, which is throughout assumed (and even in the Ajax is comparatively withdrawn from sight), than on the behaviour of the human agents under the destiny which the fable presupposes. In becoming the hero of a Sophoclean tragedy, Ajax acquires a depth and nobleness of character which do not belong to him in the Epic tradition. In the Iliad he is chiefly known by his tall stature and his fearless soldiership. He is a bulwark of the Achaeans in the hour of peril, but in council he sinks into insignificance, and his blunt speech and rugged bearing are regarded with something of amusement, though still, on account of his valour, with pride and awe. He is repeatedly spoken of as ranking next to Achilles both in achievements and in handsome looks 1, and so Odysseus speaks of him in the Odyssey. But in the single combat with Hector, into which he goes with a glad smile on the grim countenance 2, he modestly speaks of himself as one of many, who, though less than Achilles, are more than a match for ihe most valiant Trojans. He boasts, however, not only of his sturdy endurance, but of his skill in fight3; and this may possibly be the hint which Sophocles has followed in representing as equal to the best in prompt action and in force of apprehension, the hero whom Hector (as an enemy, but with some colour from common rumour) calls ‘a hulking braggart, blundering in speech 2.’</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="8872-9375">In this, and other scattered hints in the Iliad, as in the prayer for light, and his chivalrous bearing to Odysseus and Diomed at the funeral games, some approach may be found to the Sophoclean con- ception. But it is also possible that this higher view of him may have been maintained in some Epic rhapsody of which Ajax was the hero. Therte is no ἀριστεία of Ajax in the Iliad, where he is purposely subordinated not only to Achilles but (at the most eritical moments also) to Diomed and Patroclus, and it is quite conceivable that the above-mentioned characteristic of foresight, and also the supreme part assigned to the hero by Teucer in the defence of the ships, may have been anticipated in the Little Iliad1. Be this as it may, we have in the Ajax of Sophocles, as compared with anything extant in the earlier literature, the original conception of a character at once strong and misunderstood, in whose feeling of wounded honour, therefore, the spectator, who is made to understand him, can entirely sympathize. The poet and his audience are alone in possession of the secret of Ajax’ soul. They alone witness his demeanour at the close. In the eleventh book of the Odyssey, the shade of the son of Telamon recoils from the advances of Odysseus, and stands aloof in eloquent silence, because of the judgment of the arms. Tnat silence is interpreted for us by the tragic poet, who with happy audacity has for once represented the act of suicide upon the stage. He thus reveals to us not only the agony of the wounded spirit, but also the nobleness which was hidden from the world of his con- temporaries and, while dimly felt by those nearest to him, was partly recognised by his enemy Odysseus after his death. a. This higher mood, which shows the worth of the life that is being extinguished, consists, first, in the hero’s clear vision of his situation, agreeing with Athena’s saying that he is equal to the best in foresight. When once the illusion is past, even while the ‘sea’ of his rage is "still working after storm,’ he forthwith steadily faces the inevitable. He knows that he cannot outlive his honour, and he prepares accordingly. b. Secondly, from this first moment, his w:ll never falters, but moves straight forward to the end. In his first outburst, it is true, while as yet not fully conscious of those surrounding him, he betrays his purpose with what his followers regard as characteristic rashness and defiance of prevention. But when the mariners have sought to dissuade him, when Tecmessa has made her appeal, he withdraws with a few fierce words into complete solitude. And when he comes forth again we find that he has measured the force of the obstacles which he has to overcome, and has deliberately chosen to use the necessary means for obviating them, viz. dissimulation. Of this, however, he employs just so much as is necessary to secure his end,</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="9440-9996">and the spectator who reads between the lines perceives that while (as in Antigone) a calm resolve has taken the place of passionate defiance, the proud spirit is not yet broken. And once more the same temper becomes openly apparent, when, e hour of his departure, he makes his solitary appeal to Zeus and elios. c. In the third place, we are made to see that the pride of Ajax; which is the defect inseparable from his strength of will, is no cold or isolated feeling. It is not merely his own personal honour for which he cares, but the glory of his race. He had longed to rejoice the hearts of Telamon and Eriboea, and to enrich their hearth in the little isle with glories freshly won. In his own fall he is careful to provide for the honour as well as for the safety of his son. He knows that by the act he meditates his fame will be vindicated, and that Teucer, the faithful, will stand by to protect Eurysaces and train him in his father’s stern ways. It is for this reason, as well as with a view to his own burial, that his first action on coming to himself is to call loudly for Teucer. d. Lastly, in evidence of the tenderness of the great heart, whose inmost fibre is here disclosed to us, we have the strong attachment of the mariners, and the lowly but affectionate devotion of Tecmessa. We have also his touching words at the thought of his mother’s grief, and the warmth of his farewell not only to Salamis and Athens, but to the familiar features of the hostile land that has nourished him for ten years past. 3. But while the poet and the spectator see more in Ajax than is admitted even by Odysseus or Athena, the other persons of the drama, perhaps excepting Teucer, have but a partial view of him. Even Tecmessa has not fathomed his sense of honour, and fails to see clearly the consequence to which it must inevitably lead. To her and to the chorus he is a tower of strength, but they know little how to deal with him, and regard him as untameable and unmanageable. To Menelaus he is a soldier with no special claim to command, and more remarkable for bigness than any other quality. To Agamemnon he is simply a rebel. Thus the old Homeric picture of the burly warrior is employed by the dramatic poet to indicate the impression made on supetficial observers by the hero whom he is showing to us as ennobled by suffering. 4. While the fame of Ajax appears to have stood higher in the legend followed by Sophocles than in the Iliad, there are traces, both in this play and in the Philoctetes, of Odysseus having been some- where represented unfavourably. Here also Sophocles avails himself of both traditional aspects, the higher one, which in this case is known to us from the Odyssey, being again regarded as true. ñ 2. We see him at the opening as the friend of Athena, who, if zZealous against his foeman, is so chiefly in the interest of the army. If he is chargeable with a ‘horror naturalis, when brought face to face with a madman, this is only a human weakness, which distinguishes</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="9999-10518">the mortal from the goddess. And when he sees the depth to which his enemy is fallen, his compassion shows him human in a nobler way. 1 the close of the drama it is Odysseus whose moderating wisdom, contrasting equally with the fierceness of Ajax and the tyranny of Agamemnon, puts an end to strife, and secures the rite of burial for his enemy. Such is the real Odysseus, Laertes’ son, a figure worthy to have said the noble words that are quoted above from the Nekyia. 4. Meanwhile, how is he regarded by the Salaminians, by Ajax, by Tecmessa and Teucer? As a shameless spy, who poisons the minds of the Achaeans against the man whom he has robbed of his just honours, as the accomplice of the cruelty of Athena, as an accursed fox, the son of Sisyphus and only the reputed son of Laertes, as one whose dark-visaged soul ‘rejoiceth in iniquity,’ etc. We are reminded of the feelings of Philoctetes towards Odysseus as his arch-enemy. 5. Of the remaining plays of Sophocles, that which in structure most resembles the Ajax is the Antigone. In both, the death of the chief person precedes the peripeteia. The sequel is occupied in the one case with the vindication of Ajax, in the other with the Nemesis of Antigone. The culminating event is announced in the Ajax by the messenger reporting the prophecy of Calchas, in the Antigone by the prophet Teiresias in person. The early disappearance of the protagonist in both dramas makes the action seem broken; and if we are more affected by the judgments that overtake Creon, than we are interested in the permission obtained to bury Ajax, the defect of unity, though superficial in both cases, is almost equally felt. To dwell briefly on minor peculiarities, the prologos in both plays is separable from the main action, and there is a sensible interval between it and the entrance of the chorus. In the Ajax, as in the Agamemnon of Aeschylus, there is a long anapaestic parodos, followed by a lyric strain, while in the Antigone the parodos consists of anapaestic systems alternating with lyrical strophes and antistrophes. These two odes have more resemblance to each other than either has to the parodos of any of the other five plays. In one respect the versifica- tion of the Antigone, while more elaborate, is more severe than that of the Ajax. It has no divided lines in the dialogue, a liberty which is admitted in the Ajax, but sparingly, and always so that the division comes at the caesura 1. Each and all of these peculiarities may fairly be thought to indicate a comparatively early date of composition2. And, this being so, although the subject is one on which it is difficult to speak with confidence, it is not altogether fanciful to say that the Ajax, more than any other drama, serves to mark the transition from the manner of the Aeschylean trilogy to the perfect unity in complexity of which the Oedipus Tyrannus is the chief example. 6. Although probably separated by a considerable interval in point</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="10536-10994">of the date of composition, and certainly very different in structure, the Ajax, in respect of subject and spirit, may be compared to the Oedipus Coloneus. Both appeal, in different ways, more directly than the other five plays, to Athenian patriotism 1, and both breathe the same high faith, that the essentially noble spirit cannot lastingly fall under the displeasure of the gods. In both there are elaborate accusations which give occasion for rhetorical display. But the Coloneus moves deeper questionings, and, as already said, the Ajax comprises the struggle and the reconcilement in successive acts, while the Oedipus at Colonus is wholly, like the Philoctetes, a drama of reconciliation. 7. The rhetorical tendency which is so conspicuous in the latter part of the Ajax no doubt arises from the situation, but it is less under the control of dramatic feeling than in the altercation between Creon and Haemon or the Watchman in the Antigone. The στιχομυθίαι especially, and the antiphonal dialogue in 1142-1162, have, in this respect, a certain crudeness that does not recur. Still, hardly a line is entirely without point and movement, and there is nothing to remind us of the occasional ἀδολεσχία of Euripides. 8. The two ‘acts,’ of which the Ajax consists, are divided by a change of scene, and by the exit and re-entrance, or ἐπιπάροδος, of the chorus2. In this there is a reminiscence of Aeschylean boldness ; indeed, it is doubtful whether anything in the extant plays of Aeschylus involves such a deliberate departure from established usage as the last speech of Ajax made in the absence of the chorus, and his suicide in the sight of the spectators. That this was the result of artistic contrivance has been already seen. The desired effect could not otherwise have been produced. The spectator could not have known all, and would have imagined something behind. The action, if solitary, could not be reported, and it must be solitary. But it may fairly be questioned whether Sophocles would have ventured upon this arrangement, if when he composed the Ajax the taste of the Athenians for unity of effect had been as completely formed as it was when he produced the Oedipus Tyrannus. 9. The fortunes of the Aeacidae were often made the subject of tragedy. Sophocles wrote a ‘Peleus,’ a ‘Teucer’ and a ‘Eurysaces.’ Amongst the lost plays of Aeschylus the Ὅπλων κρίσις, the Θρῆσσαι, and the Σαλαμίνιοι turned on the fall of Ajax, and may have formed a trilogy. Euripides had a Peleus ; and of minor dramatists, Theo- dectes and Astydamas treated the subject of Ajax, Ion and Nicomachus that of Teucer. (Nauck, Tragicorum Graecorum Fragmenta.) 10.

						<p type="introduction" n="11043-11405">has many reminiscences of the epic diction 2. The tone of Il. 1046- 1315, which, to a modera reader contrasts unfavourably with the elevation of the former part of the play, afforded the spectator a necessary relief after long continued tension, and gave rise to a new interest, which to the ordinary Greek mind was at least as absorbing as the representation of individual feeling. But it must be admitted that this form of drama, in which the level place, or period of suspense, comes between the peripeteia and the catastrophe, is less perfect than the gradual subsidence of emotion that has been wrought up to the height, as in the Oedipus Tyrannus and the Trachiniae. b6. The disturbed and conflicting feelings which are present in the several crises of this drama, are reflected in the large proportion which it contains of syncopated or antispastic rhythms, such as the dochmiac, cretic, and choriambic, and also by the tendency to accumulate long syllables. Pure glyconics, on the other hand, are less prevalent than, for example, in the Antigone. The occasional introduction of dactyls assists the Epic colouring. The senarii are extremely regular, with a few marked exceptions, which are explained in the notes. The number of "light endings' is smaller than in the Antigone. The anapaests are of the "marching’ kind, accompanying regular movements in the orchestra or on the proscenium. There are no ‘lament-anapaests " as in the El., O. T., Trach. In I. 866-960, the choreutae of each semi-chorus speak or chant one by one, except in Il. 879-90, 925-36, where several voices may have joined. 11. State of the Text. Although the MSS. of the Ajax are more numerous than those of any of the other plays, the important varia- tions of reading are extremely few. Still there are not wanting traces of a tradition anterior to L. The most distinct proof of this, so far as the MSS. are concerned, is in L 1011, where see notes. The right reading of L 330 is found only in Stobaeus. But we have no means of removing the manifest corruption of both sense and metre in IL. 406, 7, 601, 2. -</p>

Although αἴθοπος (see v. rr.) may be defended, on the ground that the second part of a compound has sometimes little significance (see esp. infr. 954, κελαι- νώπαν θυμόν), yet αἴθων, which directly expresses character, is more appropriate here, and has the preponderance of MS. authority in its favour. 222. ἄτλατον οὐδὲ φευκτάν] ‘That can neither be avoided nor endured.’ 225. μεγάλων] ‘Terrible.’ The mari- ners, in their feebleness (supr. 165 foll.), are afraid of the opinion of the host.

Ajax calls upon Teucer. παῖ is frequently addressed by an elder per- son to a younger,— even by the Corin- thian messenger to Oedipus, O. T. 1008, and by Electra (under excitement) to the supposed Phocian stranger, El 1220. The picture in the Iliad, 8. 271, of Teucer retiring behind the shield of Ajax. παῖς ὡς ὑπὸ unrépa, snggests that Teucer was the younger brother. And it is natural to suppose Ajax to have been born before Telamon’s ex- pedition in which he won Hesione, the mother of Teucer.—According to Pindar in the fifth (or sixth) Isthmian ode, Ajax was given to Telamon in answer to the prayer of Heracles before the expedition. But in such details the legends are not constant. See O. C. 275. and note, Lycophr. 445 and schol. —The need of Teucer’s presence is Ajax’ first thought on coming to himself.

In this case μόνον ποιμένων is to be explained as an idiomatic expression, in which, as in μόνος τῶν ἄλλων, the privative word has a negative force: ie. You, and not the shepherds, shall avenge the sheep. Cp. Ant. 773, ἔρημος . . στίβος. (The sense might be made clearer by read- ing ποιμνίοις for ποιμένων,) Others (2) suppose ‘"shepherds " to be put figura- tively for "comforters,’ or (3) take ποι- μένων as gen. obj. = "to defend thy lord.’ Others conjecture πημονὰν ἐπαρκέσοντ’, πημονῶν dpros ὄντ’, 363. ‘Do not (1) aggravate the blow of disaster;" or (2) "Make the sorrow worse than the calamity.’ For the whole sentence, cp. Thuc. 5. 65, κακὸν κακῷ ἰᾶσθαι; O. C. 438. 366. ‘Redoubtable in valour amongst harmless beasts.’ For ἐν, cp. infr. 1315, μᾶλλον 'v ἐμοὶ θρασύς.

The instrumental dative is used, with a fore- feeling of the latter part of the sentence, for ἐκχερός. Mr. Jebb understands Ajax to mean that he had let off the Greeks in respect of personal chastisement, and merely damaged them in property.’ But this softens the antithesis too much.

But the asyndeton is rather impressive, and τῷ θεῷ may be explained "the god who gives the laugh- teror the tears.’ ‘Laughter and sorrow are in the hands of God;’ i.e. we must be patient and the position may be re- versed. The chorus reflect that the Di- vine power which now favours Odysseus and oppresses Ajax may hereafter work the opposite effect. Cp.

The syllable which has been probably lost from this line bas been variously restored, uév, νῦν, μήν, etc. having been supplied. The Triclinian reading is harmless, and is followed in the text, in the absence of better MS. authority. Ajax prays to see his enemy, that, even ruined as hie is, he may avenge himself.

Wunder conjectured οὕλιον, which restores the metre. But οὔλιος is everywhere active, and we can hardly venture to introduce it passively here. All that can be said is Ihat A6piov has probably taken the place of some equivalent word (such as πάμμορον), un- less we may be satisfied with ὀλέθρι’, the adverbial plural. Hermann’s attempt to scan the two lines thus, ἀλκίμα 0cbs b λέ- θριον αἰκίζει, -— d 2—— is unusually violent. 404. wol.. μενῶ] ‘Whither shall I go and find rest?

The Scholion, διὰ(τὴν κατὰ L) τὴν κρίσιν τῶν ὅπλων, is not inconsistent with the reading in the text, which admits of being construed thus, ‘Seeing that things here are perishing together with these victims by my side.7’ But the language is at once obscure and feeble. and the metre does not agree with the antistrophe. There must be something wrong.

But even so, there is too much of repetition for a lyric pas- sage, and it is reasonable to suppose some deeper corruption. For example, τοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ may bave grown out of πέλας, and this may be a corruption of πάλαι. Then supposing (with Schndw.) that crparo and ἀπό are excrescences in the antistrophe, we might read (405- 8), εἰ τάδε μὲν φθίνει, φίλοι, πάλαι,| μῶραις δ’ dypais προσκείμεθα, and (423-6), ἐξέρέω μέγ’, οἶἷον οὔτινα | Tpola χθονὸς δέρχθη μολόνθ’ etc. See note on1. 348.

Tecmessa and the child Eurysaces have remained on the stage in silence during the first stasimon. Ajax now unexpectedly comes forth, sword in hand, and addresses the chorus. That he dissembles with them, so far as to lead them to believe that he has abandoned his purpose of suicide, is obvious, because necessary lo the situa- tion, and is further evident on comparing 667 foll. with 835 foll., where his inmest feeling is expressed. But, just as the speech of Deianira which deceives Lichas, Trach. 436-69, contains a real indication of her character, so the studiously am- biguous words of Ajax here are the expression of an actual change of mood, —a new phase in the progress of mental recovery. The act which he contem- plates is the same which he has intended from the moment of his first awakening, but he regards it in a different temper. Calm resolution has taken the place of rage, and proud submission to the inevit- able that of rebellious fury. (Cp. supr. 389.)

(Supr. 329, 483). They, on the other hand, are only too readily deceived, —Tecmessa through the difficulty of believing that Ajax is hiding truth from ber, and both she and the chorus through their wishes being stronger than their fears. To dissemble under any cir- cumstances has been thought inconsis- tent with the native dignity of Ajax. But if this be so, it only renders the tragic contrast between his nature and his cir- cumstances more complete. Conceal- ment is no doubt foreign to the original bent of such a proud heroic soul. But Destiny has brought him to a point where it is inevitable, and the more so because of his first undisguised utter- ance, supr. 470, foll. Let a man’s native character be what it will, the passion of suicide brings with it the means for its own realization. The time that Ajax has spent within the tent appears ‘like an age’ to him, and he begins by reflecting generally, in a meditative tone, on the changes that are wrought by Time. He wonders at bis own calmness, and professes to wonder at his change of mind. 647. φύει. . ἄδηχα] ‘Rears out of darkness.’ Cp. Hes. Op. 6, καὶ ἄδηλον ἀέξει.

But, on the other hand, the bearing of the prophet to Teucer, as reported by the messenger, and the tenor of his prophecy, assure the spectator that the anger of Athena against Ajax is not lasting, and hold forth a vague promise of final peace. ἄνδρες φίλοι] The messenger, who is one of Teucer’s men, thus assures the mariners of his continued friendship in their master’s hour of need. τὸ πρῶτον stands in apposition with the sentence, Τεῦκρος παρέστι, which, as Hermann says, must be held as equivalent to Τεῦ- κρον παρεῖναι.

The allusion to the death of Agamemnon, which is the chief point in them, interferes with the poetical simplicity of the passage, and is more- over not applicable to Menelaus. The emphatic use of αὐτοσφαγής in two dif- ferent senses in the same line is awk- ward, and like an imitation. φίλιστος occurs nowhere else, and τώ5 not else- where in Sophocles; and ἐκγόνων seems to have arisen from a confusion of the death of Agamemnon with that of Clytemnestra, together with an at- tempt to include the fate of Odysseus. 844.

Accord- ing to (2) he is thinking of the dreary household at Salamis. where she who had been the wife of Telamon’s youth was now the nurse of his declining years. Cp.

They cannot be addressed to one of the Chorus, as the exit of a single choreutes is quite inadmissible; nor to one of Teucers own attendants, to whom such an exhortation as σύγ- καμνε would be superfluous. As ad- dressed to Tecmessa, the words seem harsh and peremptory; but Teucer, who has been absent, does not know the depth of her feelings, and in his eyes she is merely Ajax’ captive. Hence the words, i0", ἐγκόνει, σύγκαμνε, are an example of what is called irony, i.e. they indicate the speaker’s unconsciousness. 8fral Although not an enclitic, the particle coming at the beginning of the Iine is a strong instance of synaphea, and marks the haste with which Teucer utters his command.

A and several other MSS., is further supported by the unintelligible reading ἴδιον c. gl. οἰκεῖον in V4 which is clearly a corruption of ἥδιον, and may have given rise to ἵλεων. See Phil. 1392, and v. rr. Others ex- plain the words to mean, ‘Whose custom it is not to smile pleasantly when for- tunate.’ But such a meaning of παρεῖναι is doubtful, and the comparative is then without point.

But he has not the courage to follow this up by showing that Ajax was a public enemy. 1135. ‘Ves, because you were con- victed of having cheated him by manu- facturing votes.’ 1136. ‘He met with this reverse through the action of the court and not through mine.’ τόδε, sc. 76 σφάλμα.

The gloss on καλῶς, ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐμπείρως, both supports the reading of L pr.. and accounts for the corruption by showing that καλῶς was felt to re- quire explanation. The alliteration of #, A, is perbaps suggestive of wily subtlety. For Καλῶς . . κακά, cp. O.

In the present instance it adds liveliness to φθέγμα, which is to be taken closely with , ie. &amp; φθέγμα γενόμενον ἂν o bw εὗρες. ἐνεῦρες has been conjectured, but this compound is not found elsewhere, and no change is needed. 1146. παρέχειν is used absolutely with dative and infinitive, as frequently in Plato.

Teucer’s prayer is that his enemy may die childless, and that his body may lie unburied, as it were banished from the lap of earth.’ Cp.

The simpler expression would be either ris véaros . . ἔσται . . ἀριθμός, or, ἐς πότε λήξει 6 ἀριθμός. But véaros is already redundant, and this gives rise to the further expansion. πολυπλάγκτων is put by hypallage or condensation for τοῦ ἐμὲ πολλὰ πχαγχθῆναι, 5C. ἀπ’ οἴκου. 1187. The corruption of the word δορυσσοήτων into δορυσσόντων in most MSS. is natural enough, although there is no such participle, and the adjective, which is more expressive as well as more rhythmical, agrees in metre with the antistrophe. 1190. ἀν’ Hepea Τρωίαν, G. Wolff’s conjecture, founded on the scholion σκοτεινὴν καὶ ἀερώδη τοῖς "EA- xmo⸗i, at least gives a possible sense and meaning. The contrast between the misty Hellespont and the bright air of Salamis and Athens is a natural topic of complaint. Cp. infr. 1208, 9, del πυκιναῖς δρόσοις | Teyybuevos n6puas. Al- though Τρωΐα for Tpola does not occur elsewhere in Sophocles, it is acknow- ledged as the Pindaric form (Schndw. Pind. Ol. 2. 145). The interpolation ἀνὰ τάν may be partly due to drav preceding.

This line must be interpreted with reference to the train of thought (or of dialectic) which follows it, and which ends the dispute. Odysseus gains nis object (I) by quiet firmness, (2) by representing the burial of Ajax as a favour to himself (II. 1371, 2). He thereſore does not repel, but wilily ad- mits, the insinuation ofinte1 ested motives made by Agamemnon in L 1366. But how is Agamemnon brought to make this insinuation?

The sentiment is a noble one, and is in accordance with Odysseus words to Athena in supr. 124 (οὐδὲν τὸ τούτου μᾶλλον ἢ τοὐμὸν σκο- πῶν). But how can it provoke even from the most short-sighted of mortals an accusation of selfishness? For the ‘I’ in this case is ‘I and you, and all ren.’ It is better therefore to understand Odysseus to say, ‘Iurge this course upon you because I mean to follow it,’i.e. My vote in the council will be given in favour of permitting the funeral. Odysseus thus tacitly sets his moral influence against the authoritative voice of Agamemnon; whose rejoinder in 1366 is then the natural expression of a weak man in office who is losing the support of a powerful subordinate. It is the way of the world! Every man seeks his own ends, Isee !’ And Odys- seus in 1. 1367, without caring to resent the sneer, simply reaffirms his right to take a line of bis own, and pleads the reasonableness of his trying to win those in authority over to his side.
