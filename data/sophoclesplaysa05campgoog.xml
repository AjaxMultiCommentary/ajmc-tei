						<p type="introduction" n="975-1173">§ I. AMONG the plays of Sophocles there were many, as titles and fragments show, of which the scene was laid at Troy, and of which the action was founded on the epics of the Trojan cycle. This series ranged over the whole course of the ten years’ war, from its earliest incidents, as told in the Cypria, down to the fall of the city, as told in the Iliupersis. The Philoctetes is con- nected with this series, but the Ajax is the only remaining piece which actually belongs to it. The story is taken from sources later than the Iliad, but the conception of the hero, though modified by that later legend, is fundamentally Homeric. In the Iliad, Ajax, the son of Telamon, comes to Troy from Salamis with twelve ships, and is stationed on the extreme left of the army, at the east end of the camp,-as Achilles holds the corresponding post of honour on the right1. He is an independent chief,—subject only to the allegiance which all the chiefs owe to the Captain General, Agamemnon. There is no reference to his descent from Aeacus; nor is there anything that connects him especially with Athens2. He has</p>

II § 40). Aristotle (Rhet. I. 15 § 13) alludes to it as having been quoted by the Athenians in support of their claim to Salamis, and the inter- polation must be at least as old as the date of their controversy with the Megarians (circ. 600-595 B.C.), whether the author was Solon or not. The Alexandrian critics rejected the verse, pointing out that Ajax, on the extreme left, had the Thessalians for</p>

Gigantic in stature—taller by a head and shoulders than his fellows-and of a massive frame, he is emphatically the "bulwark " of the Greek host2. In comeliness, too, he is second only to the son of Peleus3; but "huge Ares " is the god to whom he is compared; and when he is described "with a smile on his grim face," it is in the joy of battle4. The Homeric poet illustrates the qualities of his valour—both impetuous and obstinate—by likening him, first, to a lion in his onset, and then, when he is forced back by superior numbers, to a stubborn ass, whom boys, with feeble but incessant blows, laboriously cudgel out of a corn- field5. Staunch and steadfast, he never fails his friends at need —whether it be some individual comrade, such as his half- brother Teucer, whom he protects6, or whether he comes to the rescue of the whole army at some crisis7. In the absence of Achilles, it is only Ajax who is a match for Hector. The sevenfold shield9 of Ajax is not only his characteristic attribute, but the symbol of his service,—great in attack, but especially signal in defence: and as the mighty shield is compared in</p>

Verse 557 may have been interpolated along with v. 558. If, however, it belonged to the genuine text, it must originally have been followed by more than one verse relating to Ajax, who was too important to be dismissed so curtly. 1 II. 2. 768 ἀνδρῶν αὖ μέγ’ ἄριστος ἔην Τελαμώνιος Αἴας | ὄφρ’ Ἀχιλεὺς μήνιεν. He holds the same rank in the Odyssey (11. 468); with Alcaeus (fr. 48 τὸν ἄριστον πεδ’ Ἀχίλλεα) ; with Pindar (N. 7. 27 κράτιστον Ἀχιλέος ἄτερ); with Sophocles (Ai. 1340); and in later literature (Hor. S. 2. 3. 193 heros ab Achille secundus ; Philostratus Heroic. 719 f.; Dictys 4. 5, etc.). 2 II. 3. 227 ἔξοχος Ἀργείων κεφαλήν τε καὶ εὐρέας ὤμους: 229 πελώριος, ἕρκος Ἀχαιῶν. 3 Il. 17. 279. 4 II. 7. 208 σεύατ’ ἔπειθ’ οἶός τε πελώριος ἔρχεται Ἄρης: 212 μειδιόων βλοσυροῖσι προσώπασι. 6 II. 8. 266, etc. 5 ll. 11. 548-562. 7 As in the battle at the ships, when he wounds Hector (Il. 14. 409 ff.); or in the fight over the body of Patroclus (17. 281 ff.). 8 The Greek chiefs rejoice when it falls to the lot of Ajax to meet Hector in single combat (Il. 7. 182). 9 Made of seven layers of bull’s hide, with a layer of metal nailed on the top,— χάλκεον, ἑπταβόειον-as described in Il. 7. 219-223.</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="2668-2993">the Iliad to a tower, so its owner himself is elsewhere called " a tower of strength' to the Achaeans. The Athena of Sophocles speaks of Ajax as pre-eminent not only for bravery but for prudence2. This is true to the picture of him in the Iliad. Once, indeed, after he has uttered a defiant and menacing challenge, Hector calls him "a blunderer, a clumsy braggart2"; as, in Shakespeare, Thersites calls him a ‘beef-witted lord,’ and Ulysses, "the lubber Ajax." In another place, however,—when he agrees, at the herald’s suggestion, to break off his combat with Hector, though he was having the best of it,—his chivalrous opponent recognises Ajax as one to whom the gods have given, not only "stature and might,’ but "understanding." His good sense is conspicuous in the embassy to Achilles, where he is the colleague of Odysseus and Phoenix. It is he who perceives when the moment has come for ceasing to press the inexorable hero. "Let us go hence; for I do not think that the end of our message can be gained by this mission.’ He points out to his companions that it seems hopeless to move Achilles at present: and then, turning to Achilles himself, he addresses him in words of frank reproach, but also of friendly appeal and of cordial good-will. One trait, however, marks an important difference between the Homeric and the later conception. In the play of Sophocles Ajax appears as one who has offended Athena by the presumptuous self-confidence with which he has re- jected divine aid in war. There is no trace of this in the Iliad. While he is arming for the combat with Hector, he exhorts the Greeks to pray that Zeus may help him. In the battle at the ships, after splendid deeds of valour, he retreats when he perceives, with a thrill of awe, that, for the time, the gods are against him. During the battle over the body of</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="3096-3310">Patroclus, when a thick mist has fallen on the field, his prayer for light breathes reverent submission to the will of Zeus1. Such is the Ajax of the Iliad; a mighty champion of the Greeks in their sorest need; a man of good sense and good feeling, sparing of words, but able to speak wisely in season ; loyal to his friends ; straightforward and unselfish ; frankly conscious of his strength, but placing his reliance on the help of the gods, and yielding, even in the fiercest struggle, to revela- tions of their mind. A contest between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms of Achilles, resulting in the defeat and suicide of Ajax, is first mentioned in the Odyssey2, where the sullen shade of the injured hero refuses to hold converse with the victor. It was the goddess Thetis who set her son’s arms for a prize ; "the judges were the children of the Trojans and Pallas Athena." § 2. The whole passage evidently presupposes some well- known work or works in which the contest for the arms had been related more at length. The scholiast says that "the story comes from the Cyclic poets3." There are two poems, and two only, which are known to have contained that story. One is the</p>
						<p type="footnote" n="3311-3532">1 Il. 17. 645 ff. 2 Od. 11. 543-547: οἴη δ’ Αἴαντος ψυχὴ Τελαμωνιάδαο νόσφιν ἀφεστήκει, κεχολωμένη εἵνεκα νίκης τήν μιν ἐγὼ νίκησα δικαζόμενος παρὰ νηυσὶ τεύχεσιν ἀμφ’ Ἀχιλῆος· ἔθηκε δὲ πότνια μήτηρ, παῖδες δὲ Τρώων δίκασαν καὶ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. On the last verse (547) the schol. (H) says, ἀθετεῖ Ἀρίσταρχος. It is not known on what grounds he rejected it ; whether because the verse was absent from some copies; or because it conflicted with some other version of the matter which he regarded as having better authority; or for both reasons. The context itself affords no reason for suspecting this particular verse ; on the contrary, the mention of the person who proposed the prize (ἔθηκε) is most naturally followed by a mention of the persons who made the award; and the passage would be maimed by the omission. W. Christ holds that Aristarchus was mistaken in condemning verse 547, and that it represents an early version of the story, probably that given by Arctînus in the Aethiopis (Jahr. f. Philol.1881 p. 444): see also Kirchhoff (Hom. Odyss. p. 231); and K. F. Ameis ad loc. The whole passage relating to the contest of the arms may, no doubt, be later than other parts of the Νέκυια. 3 Schol. H on Od. 11 547 ἡ δὲ ἱστορία ἐκ τῶν κυκλικῶν.</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="3538-3690">Aethiopis, by Arctînus of Miletus, which may be placed about 776 B.C. The other is the Little Iliad, which in later antiquity was commonly (though not universally) ascribed to Lesches1, of Pyrrha, near Mitylene, and of which the approximate date is 700 B.C. In the Aethiopis, which contained the death of Achilles, Ajax played a foremost part in rescuing the corpse from the Trojans- an episode imitated from the fight over the body of Patroclus in the Iliad. As to the manner in which Arctînus conceived the contest for the arms, only two details are known. (1) After the award, Podaleirius-the physician, skilled in diagnosis of obscure ailments, as his brother Machaon was the great surgeon- per- ceived a fierce light in the eyes of Ajax, and a weight upon his spirit, which were the precursors of the end :- ὅς ῥα καὶ Αἴαντος πρῶτος μάθε χωομένοιο ὄμματά τ’ ἀστράπτοντα βαρυνόμενόν τε νόημα2.</p>
						<p type="footnote" n="3691-4055">1 As Carl Robert has pointed out in Bild und Lied ("Arktinos und Lesches," pp. 222 ff.), the claim of Lesches is subject to much doubt. Hellanicus, himself a Lesbian, attributed the Little Iliad to Cinaethon of Lacedaemon, according to the scholiast on Eur. Tro. 821 ; where Thestorides of Phocis and Diodorus of Erythrae are mentioned as other writers to whom the poem had been attributed—while Lesches is not even named. The scholiast probably derived this statement from the Alexandrian Lysi- machus, a learned mythographer, whose work entitled Νόστοι is often quoted. 2 Schol. Il. 11. 515 (referring to the skill of Machaon in surgery): τοῦτο ἔοικε καὶ Ἀρκτῖνος ἐν Ἰλίου πορθήσει νομίζειν ἐν οἷς φησιν [here he quotes eight verses from Arctînus, on the skill of Machaon and Podaleirius respectively, ending with the two verses given above]. Arctînus was the author of two poems: (1) the Αἰθιοπίς, which ended with the contest between Ajax and Odysseus for the arms : (2) the Ἰλίου πέρσις, which (like the Little Iliad) probably included the healing of Philoctetes. The scholiast quotes these verses as being ἐν Ἰλίου πορθήσει. It has been supposed that they occurred in connection with the contest for the arms, and that therefore the scholiast ought to have said ἐν Αἰθιοπίδι. But it is also possible that the scholiast is right—that the verses came from the Iliupersis, and had to do with the healing of Philoctetes. Certainly, as Mr Monro has remarked (Journ. Hellen. Stud. vol. 5. p. 29), "the two lines about Ajax have rather the appearance of a parenthesis." If, however, the skill of Podaleirius was thus illustrated by a glance backward at the insight which he had formerly shown with regard to Ajax, we can scarcely avoid sup- posing that in the Aethiopis, when the contest for the arms was being related, this observation by Podaleirius had already been mentioned. The parenthesis would be clumsy and out of place, if the fact was being noticed for the first time. Indeed, such an allusion might well suggest the inference that in the Aethiopis the contest for the arms, and the effect of his defeat upon Ajax, were described with some fulness.</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="5066-5328">There is another point, however, in which it seems probable that they diverged. According to Pindar, the Greek chiefs were the judges in the contest for the arms. This account, which Sophocles follows, is fitted to win sympathy for Ajax, who appears as a victim of jealousy and of ingratitude on the part of men who had the best reason to know that he was second only to Achilles. But the Odyssey testifies to that other version according to which the judges were "the children of the Trojans and Pallas Athena." The words of the scholiast1 there deserve attention :—"The story is from the Cyclic poets. Aga- memnon, on his guard against seeming to favour either of the competitors for the arms of Achilles, brought some Trojan prisoners, and asked them by which of the two heroes they had been more injured," etc. There is no reason to doubt that the scholiast knew of this account as given in some poem (or poems) of the Epic Cycle. There is no warrant for assuming that he invented this statement to explain the verse on which he was commenting. But the Aethiopis and the Little Iliad are, so far as we know, the only Cyclic poems to which his allusion could refer. And in the Little Iliad the award of the arms was decided, not by Trojan prisoners in the Greek camp, but (as will be seen presently) by Trojan opinion reported from Troy itself. Presumably, then, it was in the Aethiopis that the Trojan prisoners acted as judges. Since that poem dated from the</p>
						<p type="footnote" n="5329-5546">1 Schol. H on Od. 11. 547. Eustathius (p. 1698) cannot, I think, be regarded as a witness of independent authority on this point, though that has sometimes been assumed. Commenting on παῖδες δὲ Tρώων δίκασαν, he says :—ἰστέον δὲ ὅτι (1) οἱ μὲν ἀπλοϊκώτερόν φασι Τρῶας καὶ Ἀθηνᾶν δικάσαι Ὀδυσσεῖ καὶ Αἴαντι περὶ τῶν Ἀχιλλέως ὅπλων ἐρίζουσι, καὶ δὴ καὶ Κόϊντος [Quint. Smyrn. 5. 128 ff.] διασκευάζει ἐν τοῖς αὑτοῦ τὴν δίκην ῥητορκκῶς. (2) ἕτεροι δέ φασιν ὅτι ἐπίτηδες Ἀγαμέμνων φυλαττόμενος τὸ δόξαι θατέρῳ τῶν ἡρώων χαρίσασθαι, αἰχμαλώτους τῶν Τρώων συναγαγών, ἤρετο κ.τ.λ. Here he is repeating, partly verbatim, Schol. H on Od. 11. 547, to which he adds nothing new. Thus he distinguishes two versions. (1) That in which the judges are simply "the Trojans," with Athena-as in the Odyssey. He names Quintus Smyrnaeus in connection with this version-and for a reason which can, I think, be perceived ; Quintus makes Nestor say, τοὔνεκα Τρωσὶν ἐφῶμεν ἐΰφροσι τήνδε δικάσσαι κ.τ.λ. (5. 157). Eustathius noticed or remembered this,— but not that, by Τρωσίν, the Nestor of Quintus meant the Trojan prisoners in the camp (as he presently explains, v. 160). (2) The version given by others (ἔτεροι)—in which the Trojan prisoners judged- was manifestly known to Eustathius only from the scholium on the Odyssey, which he reproduces.</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="11473-11868">and expresses a wish to take part in the obsequies. Teucer warmly thanks him,—contrasting his noble conduct with that of the Atreidae. He fears to accept the co-operation of Odysseus in the actual rites, lest that should displease the dead; but will welcome his presence as a spectator, and his help in conciliating the army. Odysseus assents, and withdraws. Various tasks in relation to the funeral are now assigned to the Chorus by Teucer. He raises the body of the hero, directing the child to lay his hand upon it, that he too may have a part in the office. Then Ajax is carried forth, followed by his wife and his son, with Teucer and the Salaminian warriors, to be laid by the Hellespont in his grave at Cape Rhoeteum, the grave which was to be ‘ever memorable among men1.’ § 9. The first question which this play suggests is one which must be considered before any criticism of detail can be profit- ably attempted—before, indeed, even the character of the hero himself, as drawn by Sophocles, can be properly appreciated. How did the poet conceive the subject of his drama as a whole ? What was the nature of the unity which he intended his work to possess ? Ajax dies at verse 865 : more than a third of the play follows his death, and is concerned with the question as to whether he is, or is not, to be buried. A reader is apt to feel that, with the suicide of Ajax, the principal interest has dis- appeared. Modern criticism has suggested various apologies for the latter part of the play; the supreme importance which the ancient Greeks attached to funeral rites, as affecting the condition of the departed spirit ; the advantage incidental to the controversy between Teucer and the Atreidae, that the merits of Ajax are triumphantly asserted; the edifying victory of prudence and magnanimity in the person of Odysseus. All such con- siderations, however, tend only to show, first, that this part of the play would have been interesting, on general grounds, to a Greek audience; and secondly, that it is not irrelevant to the subject of the earlier portion. But more than this is required, if the sequel to the hero’s death is to be justified as a matter of dramatic art. It has to be explained how the action of the</p>

						<p type="introduction" n="18317-18664">§ 13. In the final soliloquy of Ajax, his change of mood is obscured by another sentiment which moderns might think inconsistent with it,—viz., his fierce vindictiveness towards those who had given the award of the arms against him (vv. 835 ff.) :— And I call for help to the maidens who live for ever, and ever look on all the woes of men, the dread, far-striding Furies ; let them mark how my miserable life is blasted by the Atreidae. And may they overtake those evil men with doom most evil and with utter blight!... Come, ye swift and vengeful Furies, glut your wrath on all the host, and spare not ! To the ancients, however, such utterances would have seemed perfectly compatible with the altered mood of Ajax. He has come to see that he erred in his over-weening self- reliance; he 'yields to the godsʼ and acknowledges that the office of human rulers claims respect : but he also feels im- placable resentment for a wrong. 'Benefit thy friends and hurt thy foes,ʼ was the received Greek maxim. Now and again a higher ethical teaching declares that the just man wil not knowingly injure any one1. But a man might be morally good, in the ordinary Greek view, and also pious (εὐσεβής), without accepting that doctrine : Solon, who was esteemed both, prays that he may be sweet to his friends and bitter to his foes2': Pindar, a pre-eminently religious poet, who speaks as with the voice of Delphi, expresses a like sentiment. A striking parallel to the case of Ajax here is presented by that of Oedipus at Colonus. Oedipus has found rest and peace at the shrine of the Eumenides; he has been reconciled with the gods; he is already invested with a kind of sanctity; he is on his way— like Ajax—to consecration as a hero : and it is in these circum- stances that he utters the appalling imprecations on his sons. Still, in one respect the vindictiveness of Ajax must appear monstrous; he invokes destruction, not only on the chiefs, but</p>

						<p type="commentary" n="30268-30624">The first paragraph of this ὑπόθεσις (ending with dvaybyparrat) is complete in itself, and is the work of a well-informed Alexandrian scholar. The second part (beginning at ταῦτα utv οὖν) is a more diffuse composition by a feebler hand, and in Greek of a worse quality,—as may be seen (e.g.) in the use of ἔξεισι (twice) as=tp- xerai, and of ὑποκρινόμενος with infin. as = προσποιούμενος. 1 ANTHNOPIAAI] All the plays mentioned here were by Sophocles. The subject of his Antenoridae is indicated in Strabo xI1II. p. 608. When Troy was taken, the Greeks spared the house of Antenor (one of the Trojan yépovres), who had shown hospitality to Odysseus and Menelaiis, when they came as envoys (Il. 3. 207). He and his sons then joined the Paphlagonian "Everol (Ii. 2. 852), who had fought on the Trojan side in the war, and went with them, by way of Thrace, to the country after- wards known as Venetia, on the N.W. of the Adriatic. Attius also wrote an Antenoridae, probably based on that of Sophocles. 2 AIXMAAGTIAEZ] We may infer that these were Trojan women, and formed the Chorus; but nothing is known of the plot. A. Schöll and Bergk suppose that it concerned the restoration of Chryseis to her father. Welcker, on the other hand, thinks that the central incident was the death of Hector’s son, Astyanax (told by Aretinus in the Iliupersis), and that Attius founded his Astyanax on this play (Gr. Trag. I. pp. 171 ff.). EAENHZ APIIATH] Not mentioned elsewhere. But Sophocles wrote a Ἐλένης Ἀπαίτησις, and this may be the play meant. The subject was probably an embassy of Greek chiefs to Troy (like that noticed in I. 3. 205 ff.), to demand that Helen should be surrendered. Alexis, the poet of the Middle Comedy, wrote a ENvs Ἀρπαγή, and this may have caused the error. Welcker, however, conjectures that Ἐλένης Ἀρπαγή was really the title of a play by Sophocles, on a subject furnished by the Iliupersis-viz., Menelaiis finding Helen in the house of the Trojan Deiphobus, and taking her away to the ships (Gr. Trag. 1. 158 ff.). MEMNOGN] Not</p>

Tzetzes on Lycophron 464 : Dares Phrygius, Hist. de excidio Troiae c. 35). 3 πηλὸν κατ’ αὐτοῦ βαλεῖν] This story, of which the source was perhaps a satyr-play or a comedy, was used by Sophron (c. 450 B.C.) in one of his mimes (frag. 44). 5 τῆς πλευρᾶς] Aeschylus, in his Θρῇσσαι, had represented Ajax as vulnerable only in the side (τὰ πλευρά, schol. Lycophr. 455: Aesch. frag. 83, Nauck, 2nd ed.: cp. schol. Ai. 833). The author of this Argument has inferred from v. 834, πλευρὰν διαρρήξαντα, that Sophocles followed the same tradition. ἱστορεῖ καὶ Πίνδαρος] In Isthm. 5. 45 ff. Heracles merely prays that the lion-skin which he is wearing may be a symbol of the strength which shall be given to Eriboea’s son (ἄρρηκτον φυάν, σπερ τόδε δέρμα, κ.τ.λ.). The author of the Argument may have had only a vague recollection of that passage; or he may refer to some lost work of Pindar. As to this post-Homeric legend, see Introduction, § 4.</p>

						<p type="commentary" n="32294-32570">Scene :—Before the tent of Ajax, at the eastern end of the Greek camp, near Cape Rhoeteum on the northern coast of the Troad. ODYSSEUS is closely examining footprints on the sandy ground. ATHENA is seen in the air (on the θεολογεῖον). According to the rule of the Greek theatre, the side of the scene on the spec- tator’s right represents the home-region,- in this case, that of the Greek camp. To the spectator’s left is the region of the open country, stretching east and south from the camp, over the plain of Troy, towards those ‘Mysian highlands’ from which Teucer returns (v. 720). Aristotle speaks of σκηογραφία as an invention dis- tinctive of Sophocles (Poet. 4: see Smith’s Dict. of Ant., new ed., vol. II. p. 816). And the words in v. 4, ἔνθα τάξιν ἐσχάτην ἔχει, rather suggest that the Greek camp was somehow indicated here,—perhaps with a glimpse of the Hellespont, and of Cape Rhoeteum. It is not known whether the theatre of the fifth century B.C. had περίακτοι,—those triangular prisms on pivots, with scenery painted on each of their three faces, which served as movable side-scenes. A periaktos on the specta- tor’s right could have been used to show the camp. Or, if this resource was not then available, the purpose may have been effected by painted hangings on the back-wall, which, in the fifth century B.C., was probably a temporary structure of wood. With regard to the change of scene after v. 814, see note on 815. 1-188 Prologue. Athena confirms the surmise of Odysseus as to the guilt of Ajax ; shows her favourite his afflicted foe; and points the moral.</p>

According to Aristotle, the Laconian dogs were cross- bred with foxes (ἐξ ἀλώπεκος kal κυνὸς ol Λακωνικοί, Hist. Anim. 8. 28, p. 607 a 3). He describes them as a small breed, with long nostrils and keen scent (ὅσων ol μυκτῆρες uaxpol, olov τῶν Λακωνικῶν κυνι- δίων, ὀσφραντικά; Gener. Anim. 5. 2, . 781 b 9).

The Molossian dog is often associated with the Laconian 5 or. Epod. 6. 5 Molossus aut fulvus Laco: Verg. G. 3. 405 Velocis Spartae catulos acremque Mo- lossum); but Aristotle tells us that the Molossian breed had no special merit for sporting purposes; its best product was the large sheep-dog. The chief points common to the Laconian and Molossian breeds were courage and pertinacity (dv- δρία and φιλοπονία, Arist. Hist. An. 9. 1, p. 608 a 31). The use of the feminine gender by Sophocles here may be illustrated by Aristotle’s remark,-al Λάκαιναι koves al θήλειαι εὐφυέστεραι τῶν ἀρρένων εἰσίν, i.e., ‘of a finer intelligence " (ib. p. 608 a 27).—Cp.

Rh. 3. 1299 ἐὕρινοι is not from ps, but from pwbs,— of good leather.’) But the form is correct in it- self; such alternatives were frequent (cp. σύζυγος by the side of σύζυξ, etc.); and three points here recommend the nomina- tive. (1) The order of the words ὥς τις εῦρινος βάσις. (2) The idiom, consonant with tragic style, by which the epithet of the hound is transferred to Bdois: cp. Eur. H. F. 450 γραίας ὅσσων .. πηγάςς: Phoen. 1351 λευκοπήχεις κτύπους χεροῖν. (3) The fact that βάσις, with no epithet, would be somewhat weak. Libanius (c. 350 A.D.) took εὕρινος as nom., vol. 4. p. 1065 εὐρίνῳ βάσει τὸ λανθάνον ἀνιχνεύ- ovres.

(1) The emphasis on voice and thought-— pya, φώνημα, ξυναρπάζω pperl—is so strong as</p>
						<p type="commentary" n="34600-34893">to imply that he does not see her, even at a distance. (2) There can be no doubt that she was visible to the audience. She was probably on the Geooyeiov,—a sort of platform, which projected from the wings, at the back of the proscenium, and close to its upper edge. If, then, Odys- seus spoke of her as ‘seen only afar,’-a dim vision in the clouds,—the effect would be scarcely happy for the spec- tators, whose eyes could measure the actual distance between goddess and hero. On the other hand, there would seem nothing strange in her remaining invisible to him. In the Hippolytus, Aphroditè speaks the prologue, and was ceaia. visible to the spectators; but not to Hippolytus, who says, κλύων μὲν αὐδήν, Guua 5 οὐχ ὁρῶν τὸ σόν. When Ajax comes ſorth, ε, indeed, appears to see her (v. 91, xaip’ Abdva, k.7. \.) ; while to Tecmessa she is invisible (301). Butthis, again, would not be incon- sistent with Greek belief. In Il. 22. 277 Athena restores the pear to Achilles, yet isunseen by Hector. In I. 1. 198 she ap- pears to Achilles, but theotherssee her not. For ἄποπτος as = "out of sight,’ cp. El 1488 (of Acgicthas) πρόθες ἄποπτον ἡμῶν Dionys. Hal. 2. 54 ἐν ἀπόπτῳ τίθενται Tv χάρακα (‘in a place out of sight’.. It may be added that we might suppose Athena to be invisible to Odysseus now, without necessarily ex- cluding the idea that she becomes visible to him at a later moment in the dialogue. Thus in Eur. Hipp. 1 2 the presence of Artemis is known to Hippolytus only by a divine fragrance, though to the spec- tators she is doubtless visible; but a little later he beholds her (1440).—See Ap- pendix.</p>

Homer mentions the trumpet only in similes, as when the voice of Achilles is likened to it (II. 18. 219, etc.).

The adj. τρανής is not elsewhere extant but τρανῶς is used by Aesch. (Ag. 1371) and Eur. (El. 758). The form τρανός was current in later Greek ; the earliest instance seems to be Dionys. Halic.

Similarly ἐθελήμων is the form used by Plato (Crat. 406 A), while the earliest authority for θελήμων is Apoll. Rhod. 2. 557. In tragic iambics θέλω was naturally preferred, on metrical grounds, to ἐθέλω, though the latter occurs in tragic anapaests (as O. T. 1303, Ph. 145). If θελοντής were found in a passage where metre required it, the rarity of the form would not justify its rejection. But where, as here, aphaeresis was avail- able, it is surely more probable that the poet wrote ἐθελοντής.—ὑπεζύγην, as if the task were a yoke under which he placed himself: cp.

The idiom occurs in the Iliad (as 8. 24),—sometimes with σύν added (as 14. 498), a form of it found also, though not often, in later poetry (Eur. Ion 32 αὐτῷ, ξὺν ἄγγει).— ἐπιστά- ταις, ‘overseers,’ ‘masters’ or ‘guardians’ of them ; as a warrior is ὅπλων ἐπιστάτης (Aesch. Pers. 379), and a rower, ἐρετμῶν (Eur. Helen. 1267). Cp. Eur. fr. 188. 4 σκάπτων, ἀρῶν γῆν, ποιμνίοις ἐπιστα- τῶν. The herdsmen being dead, there was no one who could identify the as- sailant. 28 πᾶς τις. The deed was found out at dawn. Common rumour at once pointed to Ajax. Then the ὀπτήρ (29) informed Odysseus, who reached the tent of Ajax very soon after the latter’s return; as is shown by 296—304 compared with 91—113. νέμει: cp. Galen 7. 582 (Kühn) οὐκ ἴσην ἅπασι νέμει τὴν αἰτίαν.—The cor- rupt τρέπει may have come from the gloss on ἐκείνῳ..νέμει which occurs in some of the later MSS., εἰς αὐτὸν τρέπει. This is one of the few instances (like Ant. 386 and 831) where a true reading, lost in L, has been preserved in other MSS. Cp. crit. notes on 44, 61. 29 τις placed before its noun: 1163: Ph. 519.—ὀπτὴρ, a scout; cp. Od. 14.</p>

						<p type="commentary" n="49264-49517">Artemis Ταυρική (or Ταυρώ) had orgiastic elements ; it was of Asiatic origin, and belonged to a primitive stage of nature- worship. The ritual was a bloody one, and in early times involved human sacri- fice. This was the Artemis whose cult was said to have heen brought to Brauron in Attica, from the Tauric Chersonese, by Iphigeneia and Orestes. It is possible that Sophocles here was thinking only of the Ταυροπόλος proper, and names her simply because bulls had been among the victims of Ajax. On the other αι the savage nature of the bloody onslaught might suggest that she was associated in his thought with the Ταυρική. Such an association occurs as early as Eur. I. T. 1457 where the Brauronian Artemis (ἐπώνυμον γῆς Tav- ρικῆς, 1454) is called Ταυροπόλοι. The dithyrambic poet Timotheus of Miletus (c. 400 B.C.) addressed the Ephesian Artemis as μαινάδα, θυιάδα, φοιβάδα, λυσ- σάδα (Bergk fr. 1). See Appendix. Aiòt, (daughter) of Zeus: cp. 1302 Aaoubdorros. But the art. (ἡ) is prefixed to Διὸς in 401, 450. 173 f. peydMa refers primarily to the strength and loudness of the popular rumour (198 f.); but also suggests dread or horror, as when impious words are called μεγάλοι λόγοι (Ant. 1350).

But this is awkward. And, in support of ἀδώροις, it should be noted that Sophocles else- where also has co-ordinated a causal dat. with a partic. (or adj.) of causal force, like ψευσθεῖσα here.

Od. 9. 405 f. ἦ μή τίς σεο μῆλα βροτῶν ἀέκοντος ἐλαύνει; ἢ μή τίς σ’ atrov κτείνει δόλῳ ἠὲ βίηφι; O.

(4) e has also been suggested. But the implied construction, uoupdv ἔχων, εἴ τιν’ (εἶχεν), would be too harsh. (5) 4 is condemned by the fact that with Sopho- cles this interrogative regularly stands first in its clause; only a vocative some- times precedes it: see on Ant. 1281. Ἰνυάλιος is in the Iliad either the War-god (2. 651), seemingly identical with Ares, or an epithet of Ares (17. 211 Apns | δεινὸς ἐνυάλιος). Like Ἐνυώ, the word is of uncertain (possibly Thracian) origin. The mention of this deity has a two-fold fitness here; (1I) on account of the reference in 178 to Artemis Agrotera; for, acc. to Pollux 8. 91, the Athenian Polemarch made annual offerings Ἀρτέ- mbdi’ Aypordpa καὶ τῷ Ἐνυαλίῳ (2) because in the island-home of Ajax there was a</p>

(His further change of πάντων into ἀπάντων is merel for the sake of equalising this v. wit 197f.) The main facts are these. 1. Aristophanes uses καχάζων once (Eccl. 849). and also the noun καχασμῶν (Nub. 1073). 2. It is true that καγχάζω cannot be proved by metre from any verse earlier than that of Babrius (100. 8 καγ- χάσας), and Paulus Silentiarius (6th cent.) in Anth. Pal. 6. G 3 (καγχάζουσα). 3. On the other hand the MSS. have ἀνεκάγ- xace in Plat.

Tim. p. 84 σ 5rav . . νοσήσ. 208 f. τί δὲ βάροι ἐνήλλακται νὺξς #84 τῆς ἡμερία; "And what heaviness cerved in xhan for the (aLey griev- ous) fortune of the day?’ ἑνήλλακται in a midd. sense; cp. Diod. frag. 60 ἐγένετο βασίλισσα ἰδιωτικῆς ἑστίας ἐξηλλαγμένη ἡγεμονίαν. The fact that ἤλλαγμαι has more often a passive sense in Attic is quite compatible with such an exceptional use; thus Antiphon can say, rov πλοῦν πεποιημένος (or. 5 § 21), and τετιμωρη- uébvos ἑαυτόν (Tetr. B. β. § 8). But it is more doubtful whether such a notion as uolpas, πράξεως, or καταστάσεως can here be supplied with rfjs hueplas. The paral- lels adduced are such as 4 ἑῴα, ἡ ἑωθινή, ἡ ὀψία, ἡ πρωΐα, τὴν θερείην (in summer,’ Her. 1. 189), τὴν χειμερινήν (id. 1. 202). There was indeed a tendency in Greek idiom to make substantives out of fem. adjectives; i.e. to use the fem. adj. alone, whenever the subst. (such as γῆ, ὁδός, ὥρα, μοῖρα, δίκη) could readily be under- stood. And that tendency must be con- sidered here.</p>

And the words v ἥδε suggest that there was some mention of day. On the whole, the traditional reading, though difficult, is less open to objection than any remedy which has been proposed.

As Ajax purposed to Odysseus (110), the ram which suf- fers that fate here might naturally be identified with him. The first ram, which is beheaded at once, might then represent Agamemnon; and Menelaiis would here be ignored. On this view, however, there is a discrepancy with verses 97-110, since both the Atreidae are there sup- posed to be dead, while Odysseus has still to suffer. Here one ram (Agamem- non) is slain, and the other (Odysseus) flogged, in rapid succession.</p>
						<p type="commentary" n="55899-56154">If the two rams are the two Atreidae, then Odysseus is ignored here. This would be consistent both with vv. 979- 110 and with 298—306. The flogging of the second ram here would correspond with the words robs δὲ δεσμίους | ἠκίζεθ’ in 299 f. Then came the colloquy of Ajax with Athena (301); after which, he slowly regained his sanity,—before he had inflicted the lash upon Odysseus. That the "two rams’ are here the royal brethrem might be suggested by the analogy of the: two eagles in Ag. 115. On a other hand, the special ferocity with which Ajax treats the second ram rather in- dicates that it represents Odysseus. There would be no point in so distinguishing Menelaüs from Agamemnon. Dn the whole, it seems most probable that the post meant Agamemnon and Odysseus, ut was careless of strict consistency with vv. 97-110. 288 xipaiv καὶ γλῶσσαν dxpav.

						<p type="commentary" n="69793-70017">them have all been designed to suit some emendation in 405 ff., and would have no probability if verses 423 ff. were con- sidered simply on their own merits. (2) There is only one real discrepancy of metre between the traditional text here and that of the antistrophe; viz., that rotoðꝰ in 406 answers to the rwa of οὔ- riva in 424, where the a, being the last syllable of a verse, could be either long or short, and is here long. (Some, indeed, read οὔτιν’ d: cr. n.) That is, instead of τοῖσδ’, we require --. As to ἐξερέω in 423, answering to el ra μὲν in 405, we should write ἐξερῶ. With re- gard to the diction of 405 ff., the most suspicious point is the redundancy ὁμοῦ πίλαςι, suggesting that one of the words was a gloss upon the other. (3) If, then, we assume that the anti- strophe is sound, we may conclude that the fault in the strophe lies within the words el τὰ μὲν φθίνει, φίλοι, τοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ πέλας. A very slight change will restore the metre, viz. τοισῖσδ’ for rolc" : cp. the words of Ajax in 453 ὥστ’ ἐν τοιοῖσδε χεῖρας aludtac βοτοῖς. There he points to the slain cattle around him ; and so he probably does here also. We could then understand the sense to</p>

But πέλας may have been a marginal gloss (on buob), which has displaced some other word: e.2., the poet may have written τοιοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ βοτοῖς (cp. v. 53). (4) Whatever may have been the giaal form of the words el τὰ μὲν φθίνει, φίλοι, τοῖσδ’ ὁμοῦ πέλας, it is at least highly probable that their general sense was, "If my old renown is perish- ing.’ This is suggested by the other passages where we find the same se- quence of ideas,—i.e., the thought of his past glory closely followed by that of his present disgrace; see (1) 421-427: (2) 437-456: (3) 612-621. (5) Those who believe that the anti- strophic verses 423—a427 are corrupt have a freer hand for emendation here; and, as will be seen in the Appendix, some of the proposed restorations have been very bold.

This usage of ἐπώνυμος, with ref. to the ames of a name (or sur- name), is different from that in which a person or thing is said to be ἐπώνυμός Twos, either as (1) being named from it, or (2) giving a name to it.

But the associa- tion of Alas with al al appears in the legend that a hyacinth (on whose petals the letters AI were supposed to be legible, Moschus 3. 6) sprang from the blood of Ajax, as it had sprung from that of Hyacinthus: Ov. Met. 13. 397: Littera communis mediis pueroque viroque Inscripta est foliis; haec nominis (Ajax), illa querelae (the wail of Hyacinthus). So Odysseus was associated with ὀδύσσ- ομαι (Od. 1. 62 rt νύ ol τόσον ὠδύσαο, Ζεῦ; imitated by Soph., fr. 880): Pen- theus, with πένθος ur. Bacch. 507): Polyneices, with νεῖκος (Aesch.

Such play on names did not seem to the Greeks unworthy of grave poetry, because to them the omens conveyed by words (ὀμφαί, kAnbves) were so serious.

When this new fact or thought raises a difficulty in the way of something proposed by the last speaker, then kal μήν acquires an ad. versative force. Thus here, its literal sense, ‘and verily," ‘indeed,’ is tinged by te context with the sense, ‘oh, but,’ or , but.’ The effect of γε is to place a — stress on φόβοισι.

I. p. 459, art. clipeus). It was a leathern thong, run- ning round the inner edge of the shield, and fixed at intervals of six inches or so by ins or nails, so as to form a succession of oops. The name, πόρπαξ, was derived from these pins (πόρπαι), which could be taken out, when it was wished to remove the πόρπαξ and so to unfit the shield for immediate use. (It is made a charge against Cleon in Ar. Eq. 849 that he had dedicated the shields taken at Pylos αὐτοῖσι τοῖς πόρπαξιν.) But a loop at the edge of the shield, such as the πόρπαξ offered to the warrior’s hand (Eur. Helen. 1376 ἐμβαλὼν xop- πακι γενναίαν xépa), would not suffice to give him control. Hence, in the vase- painting noticed above, we see the rdprat combined with another contrivance, viz., a band (of metal, or wood), placed verti- cally across the inside of the shield, and furnished at the middle with an arrange- ment of small bars, forming a support for the arm just below the elbow. This band was the ὄχανον or bxdvn.—See Ap- pendix. πολυρράφου (‘much, or well, stitched’) is a general epithet for elaborate leather- work, and is again illustrated by the vase-painting cited above, where orna- mental tassels hang from the pins which divide the loops of the πόρπαξ.

Sophocles in this play follows the legend that the body of Ajax was in- terred, and not, as was the ordinary practice in the heroic age, burned (cp. 1166 n.). The reference to the burial of the arms is thus perfectly fitting. There was less meaning in the practice, noticed by Homer, of burning a warrior’s armour with him; II. 6. 418 ἀλλ’ dpa μιν κατέκηε σὺν ἔντεσι δαιδαλέοισιν Od. 11. 74 ἀλλά ue κακκῆαι σὺν τεύχεσιν. It may have come down from the earlier days when interment was the rule. No arms are burned on the pyre of Patroclus (II. 23. 165 ff.), Hector (24. 785 ff.), or Achilles (Od. 24. 65 ff). kolv’ ἐμοὶ; κοινὰ is here adv.: cp. Ant. 546 μή μοι θάνῃς σὺ κοινά.</p>

Ajax is now withdrawn into the tent on the eccyclema (εἰσκυκλεῖται), and the entrance is closed. Tecmessa and her child retire by another door into the part of the dwelling which is supposed to re- present the γυναικών. They re-enter after the Choral ode, and are present while Ajax speaks (see 684 ff.). Some, indeed, suppose that they remain on the scene during the ode; but the command of Ajax to Tecmessa in 579f., μηδ’ ἐπι- σκήνους γόους | δάκρυε, is against this. Welcker thinks that not only Tec- messa (with the child), but Ajax also, re- main Dresent during the ode. (Rhein. Mus. for 1829, part 3, p. 87.)

Now, in favour of Idala.. Aecudwi’ ἔπαυλα, let it be noted that, if ἔπαυλα was the genuine word, then the corruption of μηνῶν into μήλων is at once explained; for ἔπαυλα meant properly a fold for cattle, as in O. T. 1138, where it is synonymous with ecra6ud. Here, how- ever, it would have the general sense which it bears in O. C. 669, ἵκου τὰ κράτιστα γᾶς ἔπαυλα, ‘dwellings,’-a sense in which σταθμά too was poetically used. No other conjecture accounts for the origin of μήλων. The construction then is, εὐνῶμαι Ἰδαῖα λειμώνια ἔπαυλα, I am encamped in quarters on the fields of Ida,’ μηνῶν ἀνήριθμος, ‘through countless months.’ For the acc. with εὐνῶμαι, cp. such phrases as Svybw ἔζομαι (249 n.). κεῖμαι τόπον (Ph. 1441.).

The maxim is two-edged. φιλεῖν ὡς μισή- σοντα is the side of it which is really in the mind of Ajax: —he dies hating the Greeks whom he had served so nobly (839-844). But the other side—macety ὡς PpuNMocorra—is that which he wishes his hearers to conceive as foremost in his thoughts. Arist.

This is a ground for rò φιλεῖν ὡς μισήσοντα, but not (directly, at least) for the con- verse; and bewrays what is really upper- most in his mind.

Some have supposed that ἑταιρεία was the form used in the sense of Sactio, or party ‘association,’ and ἑταιρία in that of amicitia; but there is really no good evidence for this.

C. 868 θεῶν | ὁ πάντα λεύσσων Ἥλιος (unless θεὸς should be read there). But bere the meaning seems to be that Pan represents the gods in this function. Pan was to rustic xopol, those of nymphs and satyrs, what Apollo Μουσαγέτης was to the Olympians; and the province denoted by xoporoiòs here is thus limited by the context. So Pindar fr. 75 calls Pan xopeurav τελεώτατον θεῶν; and an Attic σκολιόν greets him as ὀρχηστά, Bpoulais ὀπαδὲ voupais. Νύσια: such dances as the worshippers of Dionysus-—with whom Pan is closely associated through the satyrs -—hold in his honour at Nysa. As to the various places so called, see on Ant. 1131. Kvdowa: such dances as the Cretan Corybantes hold at Cnosus in honour of Zeus and Apollo. Both the epithets Νύσια and Kveiboa denote a character of wild enthusiasm.—Cnosus, the chief city of Crete, was situated in the north of the island, in one of the plains at the foot of Ida.

Crete was the part of Hellas in which an art of ὀρχη- στική was first elaborately cultivated; The hyporcheme itself was originally Cretan (schol. on Pind. P. 2. 127) αὐτοδαῆ is best explained, with the schol. in L, αὐτομαθῆ, a σὺ σαυτὸν ἐδί- δαξας. Pan is the inspired and inspiring χοροποιός. The dances will be joyous as those of Nysa or Cnosus, but due to his prompting alone. So the minstrel Phe- mius says, αὐτοδίδακτος δ’ elul, θεὸς δέ μοι ἐν φρεσὶν οἵμας | παντοίας ἐνέφυσεν, Od. 22. 347. ἰάψῃ (cp. 501) here denotes properly the act of putting forth the feet or the arms in lively movement; so that ἰάπτειν ὀρχήματα means strictly, ‘to dance with lively gestures.’ The musician Aris- toxenus (c. 300 B.C.) mentioned the Κρη- τικαὶ ὀρχήσεις among those which he admired διὰ τὴν τῶν χειρῶν κίνησιν (Athen. I. p. 22). How ἰάπτω could be asso- ciated with swift motion, appears from the intrans. use in Aesch. Suppl. 547 ἰάπτει 5 Ἀσίδος δι’ atas (‘rushes).—Pan might possibly be said ldwrew ὀρχήματα as ‘impelling’ the dance, i.c., ‘setting it in movement’; but this seems less probable. 701 χορεῦσαι, aor., because a par- ticular occasion (or act) of dancing is in view: but in O.

Curtius (Etym. § 142) thinks that this distinction was of comparatively late origin. Our MSS. con- sistently give eloxri, elpyubs, ‘a prison. Andoc. or. 4 § 27 has εἰργνύων ("im- prisoning’) : Plat.

On the other hand in Eur. Bacch. 443 the best editions give elptac. It may be noted that Lobeck could find no instance of ἀφείργειν earlier than Aelian (Hist.

But ὀλεθρίαν . .ppe could not mean, ‘is of fatal tendency.’ Such a fusion of ὀλεθρίαν εἶναι with ppe εἰς ὄλεθρον is impossible. Nor can we render: ‘He (Teucer) fore- bodes that this going-forth, which he announces, will be fatal to Ajax.’ φέρειν could be said only of the messenger— not of the man who sends him. Paley’s conjecture, ἐλπίζω φέρειν, meets the point as to φέρειν, but the change to the first person is too harsh. Bothe’s ἐλπίζειν φέρει (‘Teucer announces that he fore- bodes,’ etc.) strains both verbs. Enger's ἐλπίζει κυρεῖν is somewhat tame, and does not seem very probable. Could ὀλεθρίαν Alavros have come from Atavros dls S\eGpov? Easily, doubt- less, if els had been lost after -es. I incline to this solution. Alavros els ὄλεθρον is not only aarl better, but also slightly more probable, than ὅὄὅλεθρον εἰς Alarros (the reading of Blaydes in his text), since then els follows -ov, and its unusual postion would also tend to prevent its eing overlooked.

Tecmessa has already heard that the ἔξοδος is perilous. The new fact which she is now to learn is that ‘this day’ must decide the fate of Ajax.

The definite expression of that fear, by σπεύδῃ θανεῖν, is a fitting close to this scene, and prepares for the next. As to the diction of the verse, three claim notice. (1) The γε after νδρα emphasises, not that word, but the whole clause, dvpa ὃς σπεύδῃ θανεῖν. Cp. Ant. 213 f., 648 f.: El. 1506: O. C. 1278. It contrasts pas with his σπουδή.

The Chorus leave the orchestra in two ἡμιχόρια, one by the ndpods on the right, the other by that on the left.

The right-hand περίακτος, indicating the region in which the whole action takes place (χώρα), would not have been changed. The only other Greek play in which a change of scene is certain is the Eu- menides, where the action begins at the temple of the Delphian Apollo, and passes at v. 235 to that of Athena Polias at Athens. This may have been marked merely by substituting a statue of Athena for one of Apollo. |818 Ajax is standing at the side of the scene on the spectator’s right, near the underwood which screens him when he falls-so that his body is not at first visible to the Chorus when they return to the orchestra, but could be seen by Tecmessa, when she comes on the scene from the left. The point of the sword could probanty be seen by the audience. Hesychius quotes Polemon, the sophist in Hadrian’s age, as saying that the συσπαστὸν was used dv Αἴαντος ὑποκρίσει.

(1) The poet would not have made the dying Ajax pray that the Atreidae may die ‘at the hands of their offspring,’ unless there had been some legend that they so died. But, according to the current mythology, Agamemnon was slain by his wife and her paramour, while Menelaiis and Helen passed, without dying, to Elysium (Od. 4. 561). It is only in later times that we meet with the story of Menelaüs and Helen havin been sacrificed by Iphigeneia in the lan of the Tauri (Ptolemy Heph. 4, cp. Roscher, Lex. p. 195 5. a myth which the author of these verses may have had in view. Odysseus, indeed, was slain by Telegonus; but he does not come into account here, unless we make the improbable change of Ἀτρειδῶν to Axaidv in 838. [As to the double sense of αὐτο- σφαγής, with ref. to one who is slain (1) by himself, (2) by a kinsman, see on Ant. 56 αὐτοκτονοῦντε.] (2) These two verses confuse the con- struction, since ὥσπερ εἰσορῶσ’ ἐμέ (sc. ξυναρπασθέντα) refers to what precedes : while ras in 841 refers to ὥσπερ.

We should not, then, insist on τώς as a mark of spuriousness: and ὀλοίατο is, of course, free from objection (O. T. 1274 yvwoolaro n.). But the case against 841 f. seems conclusive without them. : A more difficult question is whether vv. 839, 840 are also spurious. The schol. in L on v. 841 is as follows: —ꝝ 2 atroopayeis: rabra νοθεύεσθαί pacw ὑποβληθέντα πρὸς σαφήνειαν τῶν λεγ- μένων. As the lemma, τὼς αὐτοσφαγεῖς, clearly indicates, ταῦτα refers only to the two verses 841 f., and not (as Dindorf and others have assumed) to all the four verses 830—842. The surmise was, says the scholiast, that vv. 841 f. were added to make the meaning clearer’; i.e., to explain the elliptical phrase, ὥσπερ eloo- ρῶσ’ ἐμέ. Sach a surmise itself shows that vv. 839, 840 were believed to be older than 841 f. It is indeed plain that all four verses are not by the same author. The incoherent construction noticed above, under (2), was possible for an interpolator whose attention was fixed on ὥσπερ εἰσορῶσ’ 4ué, but hardly for one who was forging vv. 839—842 as a whole. If, then, all four verses are condemned, we must assume two independent inter- polations. I incline to think that the two verses 839 and 840 are genuine ; because, other- wise, the imprecation on the πάνδημος στρατός (844) would follow too abruptly on v. 838.

In support of πασῶν, however, these points should be considered. (1) ἁπασῶν could easily arise through the scribe’s eye wandering to dwderwe in 992: and no MS. which has ἀπασῶν alters the order of the words ὁδός θ’ ὁδῶν. (2) After τῶν axdvrir.. θεαμάτων ἄλγιστον, there is a rhetorical advantage in having ὁδός θ’ ὁδῶν πασῶν rather than ὁδῶν 6 ἀπασῶν ὁδός.

Some suppose that here, too, κνώδοντος denotes the handle of the sword, against which the corpse is resting. But there are at least two decisive ob- jections to that view,—(1) the singular number, (2) the epithet αἰόλου. Lycophron borrows the word κνώδων from this passage, in alluding to the suicide of Ajax (464): δυσμενεστάτου ξένων | ἔτυψε δώρῳ σπλάγχνον, ἀρνεύσας λυγρὸν | πήδημα πρὸς κνώδοντος αὐτουργοὺς ocpayds.—For the dpa after φονέως, cp. 233 n.—4es, seest thou?’(a rhetorical apo- strophe to the corpse).

Polit. 274, Tim. 47c). Here, however, the stress marked by ¢ δὴ is on the identity of the le, not of the man; and the subject of ἐδωρήθη is Hector.— As to the exchange of gifts between Ajax and Hector (II. 7. 303 ff.), see n. on 661. 1080 πρισθς. ξ ἀντύγων, firmly bound—grigped—trom the chariot-rail. The schol. explains πρισθείς by δεθείς: Suidas, by debeis, ἐξαφθείς, δεσμευθείς. The senses of πρίω are:-1. To saw. 2. In πρίειν τοὺς ὁδόντας, to grind or clench the teeth. Suidas quotes ἐμπρίσαντες τοὺς ὁδόντας (said o men under torture). 3. To bite: Soph. fr. 811 ὁδόντι πρῖε τὸ orbua. 4. To clutch tightly (as with the teeth). 5p ian Hal. 2. 138 describes a serpent winding its coils round an ἐχῖνος (hedgehog): ἴσχει 7" ἐμπρίει re, " he holds and compresses him" (schol. πιέζει). So Hesychius: πρισμοῖς· ταῖς βιαίοις κατ- οχαῖς (‘grips’). Hence ἀπρίξ, ἄπριγδα, mordicus, "tightly’ (as between the teeth) : see above, v. 310.

The Homeric Achilles slays Hector in fight, and then drags the corpse (Il. 22. 395 ff.).

Tzet2es on Lyco- phron 682, Ζεῦ xdrep, εἴθ’ ἥσσω μὲν ἐμοὶ αἰῶνα βίοιο | ὥφελλες δοῦναι. There, how- ever, αἰῶνα Blov means "term of life. Euripides could say, ἀπέπνευσεν αἰῶνα (fr. 801); but ἀπέψυξεν αἰῶνα Blov is surely impossible. It would have been</p>
						<p type="commentary" n="127416-127672">better, for Hermann’s purpose, to keep alév and Blov, merely changing ἔστ’ to εῦτ’. As a matter of verbal criticism, it might be observed that alév and ἔστ’ confirm each other. But the defence of the text rests on broader ground. Evidently we must either reject the whole passage 1028 —roʒ9, as Morstadt and Nauck do, or else leave this verse unaltered. For the parallel between the sword and the girdle, as fatal to their respective recipients, would fail altogether, if the girdle had not been an agent of death to Hector, but merely of insult to his corpse. It is not known whence Sophocles derived this version, which so strangely mars the very climax of the Iliad; possibly from one of the two Cyclic epics, the Aethiopis of Aretinus or the Little Iliad of Lesches, which related the ὅπλων κρίσις (see In- trod. 88 2, 3). One thing, at least, seems hardly doubtful. The original motive of this version must have been the same which prompts its use by Sophocles here, -viz., to point the fatal character of Hector’s gift to Ajax by connecting a like result with the gift of Ajax to Hector. Two epigrams, attributed to Leontius Scholasticus (circ. 550 A. D.), turn on the same legend (Anthol. 7. 151, 152): see Appendix. 1062 δωριὰν Ixwy.

In II. 13. 313 Teucer is said to be ἀριστος Ἀχαιῶν | τοξοσύνῃ· but the poet adds ἀγαθὸς δὲ καὶ ἐν σταδίῃ ὑσμίνῃ.

Sophocles doubtless conceived the chiefs as voting by ψῆφοι placed in urns (cp. Aesch. Eum. 709), and this view appears in art (Introd. § 20). Eustathius remarks the anachronism (on II. 2. 852) : though, of course, neither ἐψήφισαν in 449 nor ψηφοποιός here necessarily ex- cludes the supposition that the votes were given, in Homeric fashion, by voice.—For other views of ψηφοποιός, see Appedix.

The nautical sense occurs (apart from Her. I. 24) a here, and in Eur. Helen. 1571, Cycl. 238. Hence the distinctive epithet is intelli- gible.

Ajax, indeed, distinguishes himself in repulsing the Trojans aſter they have come over the wall, and on one occasion wounds their leader Hector Ii. 14. 40 3) ; but this happens before any ship has been set on fire. The supreme crisis in this part of the Iliad is the moment when the Trojans set fire to the ship of Protesilaüs (16. 122); but just then Ajax is driven back (xdtero 5 ἐκ βελέων ib.); it is Patroclus who, urged by Achilles, then comes to the front, and finally beats back the foe. Nor has the Iliad directly farnished the picture of Hector ‘leaping high'" over the trench. Sophocles may have had some other source, epic or lyric. But it seems equally possible that he wrote from a general recollection of the Iliad, without caring whether he reproduced its details. In- deed, two verses of the Iliad might alone have sufficed to suggest the picture which he has drawn,—that which says of Ajax, Τρῶαι ἄμυνε νεῶν, ὅστις φέροι ἀκάματον πῦρ (I5. 731),—and the verse which de- scribes Hector leading the Trojans from the Greek wall towards the ships,—j p" 8 ζ ὁ cA φλογὶ εἴκελοι ἡγεμονεύει 13. 53). de1 οὗ σὺ μή, βῆναι ποδί.

Ajax did not seek to avoid being drawn by putting in, as his κλῆρος, a piece of damp earth, which would stick to the bottom of the helmet or fall to pieces. Such κλῆρος is called δραπέτης, "a runaway,’ because it eludes the ordeal. The allusion is to the story of Cresphontes. After the Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus, he, Te- menus, and the heirs of Aristodemus agreed to cast lots. The first was to have Argos; the second, Lacedaemon; the third, Messenia. Cresphontes wished to have Messenia. He therefore put a lump of earth, as his κλῆρος, into the voting urn. It broke to pieces, so that only the two other κλῆροι came out.

Nauplius, however, spared her life, and she after- wards married Atreus. The scholiast on 1297 says that this was the story treated by Euripides in the Kpfleoai (Nauck Trag.

Now, accord- ing to the schol. on Eur.

Hence it has been proposed to change πατὴρ into σ’ "Arpeds (Hermann), or σ’ ἀνὴρ (Wolff). A simpler correction would be, ὁ σ’ ἐκφύσας πατήρ. But it cannot be assumed that Sophocles must have followed here the same version which he used elsewhere. In his Ἀλήτης, for example, he appears to have modified the version of the 'Opecrela which he adopts in his Electra (see El., Introd., p. xliif, n. 4). The story of Aerop’s de- tection by Catreus is effective for the purpose here, which is to represent Aga- memnon as born of a mother who had sinned before his birth.

There is no parallel for such a genitive after νικᾷ: but it is quite intelli- gible, and seems not too bold for the. poet’s style.

The context in verses 1355 f. at once proves that the words ἀρετή and ἔχθρας are genuine; and the article before ἀρετή confirms rfis. As νικᾷ also is pre- sumably sound, the fault, if any, would have to be sought in πολύ, for which neither πλέον nor πάρος is a tolerable substitute; or else in ue. Now in a reply to the question, ἐχθρὸν ὧδ’ albet νέκυν we should expect some reference by Odysseus to his own feeling; and v. 1358 (roiolde μέντοι φῶτες further ia cates that in the preceding verse he actually did refer to himself.

Further, v. 1417, as it stands, yields no satisfactory sense. It must be taken in one of two ways: (1) by itself, a colon or stop being placed after θνητῶν :—"I speak of Ajax, in the days when he lived": for the genitive, cp. 1236. Or (2) in connexion with v. 1416, a colon being placed after Alavros. but no point after θνητῶν :—"and never yet (having toiled) for a worthier man than Ajax;-I speak of the time when he lived.’ (Cp.

						<p type="appendix" n="166350-166841">575 f. The πόρπαξ and the Gxavov.—Herodotus (1. 171) says that ὄχανα for ἀσπίδες were invented by the Carians, and that previously all men’ had managed their shields by means of leathern baldricks (τελαμῶνες σκύτινοι), slung round the neck and over the left shoulder. The shield of the Homeric warrior is indeed suspended by such a τελαμών (II. 12. 401): but it had also an equivalent for the ὄχανον, according to the most recent interpretation (Dr Wolfgang Reichel’s) of the kavbves (II. 8. 193, 13. 407). These appear to have been staves, probably of wood, one of which traversed the shield vertically, lying close to the leather, while the other ran across it horizontally, bulging out at the middle, so as to afford a handle. (See Appendix A to Leaf and Bayfield’s Iliad, p. 548: London, 1895.) There is no allusion in the Homeric poems to a πόρπαξ. But the words of Sophocles here are to be interpreted with reference to the Greek shield of the fifth century B.C., and not in the light of Homeric archaeology. Eustathius (p. 995. 19) scented the anachronism: ὅρα δὲ ὡς οὐδὲ τὸ τοῦ Alavros σάκος πόρπακα εἶχεν, ἀλλὰ τελαμῶνος ἤρτητο, ἴσως δὲ καὶ κανόνι μετήγετο (alluding to the horizontal κανών just mentioned). The nJpmat is expressly distinguished from the ὄχανον (or xdim) by Plutarch, who says that Cleomenes III. first taught the Spartans τὴν ἀσπίδα φορεῖν δι’ ὀχάνης, μὴ διὰ πόρπακος (Cleom. 11). But, as ὀχάνη was a word of general meaning ("handle’), it is not surprising to find it sometimes used as a synonym for πόρπαξ; thus αὐτοῖσι rols πόρπαξιν in Ar. Eq. 849 is explained in the scholium by cv αὐταῖς rals ὀχάναις. 601-6038 The emendations here may be classified as (I) those which keep ποίᾳ, or πόᾳ, and (II) those which alter it. I. 1. Bergk writes : TeG8. μίμνων xapa πόᾳ τε μηνῶν ἀνήριθμος αἰὲν ὠνῶμαι ie., ‘’remaining in the land of Ida, in winter and summer, through countless months' etc. For this use of πόᾳ as = "the grass-season,’ Ssummer,’ cp. Rhianus ap. Paus. 4. 17. 6 χείματά re ποίας re kai εἴκοσι wdoas: Callimachus fr. 182 ἐπ’ ἐννέα ποίας; Anthol. 7. 731 τέσσαρας πόας. But this absolute use of πόᾳ is extremely harsh. And χειμῶνι is improbable, for a reference to the λειμών on which they were encamped is most natural here (cp. Aesch. Ag. 559, quoted in the commentary). Nauck adopts Bergk’s reading. 2. G. Wolff, accepting Ἰδᾷδι from Bergk and λειμωνίδι from Erfurdt, reads : TG. μίμνων λμωνίδι ποίᾳ μή- λων ἀνήριθμος αἰὲν εὐνῶμαι. The decisive objection to this is that, instead of the g of molq, we require a short syllable, answering to the ὅ of οἰοβώτας in 614. This objection is not met by making the verse end with the first syllable of μήλων. Wolff joins μήλων (the MS. reading) with ποίᾳ ("grassy sheep- pastures’). He takes ἀνήριθμος as = dvapunros in Eur. Helen. 1679,</p>

						<p type="appendix" n="171502-171968">1120 ἀτίμα. By proscribing the verb ἀτιμᾶν, Nauck would make it necessary to alter the Homeric texts (including those of the Hymns) in about eighteen places. (a) Where the future or aorist forms of ἀτιμᾶν are now read, he would substitute the corresponding forms of driudw with oco: e.g., in N. 8. 163 ἀτιμάσσουσι for ἀτιμήσουσι: in I. 11 ἠτίμασσ’ for ἠτίμησ’. (ὐ) In other cases he would substitute forms from drw: eg., in Od. 21. 99 ἄτιζεν for ἀτίμα. 1185 ψηφοποιός. Others explain :—(1) ‘Making votes’ by tamper- ing with the ψῆφοι at the counting. This is a needlessly coarse inter- pretation, even if it could be supposed that one of the competitors could have had the opportunity for such a fraud. (2) J. van Leeuwen: Making ψῆφοι’ of clay, and giving them to those judges who were favourably disposed towards Ajax. These ψῆφοι would never come out of the voting urn (which the critic conceives as having water in it). Cp. the δραπέτης κλῆρος of v. 1285. The word ψηφοκλέπτης was used in the sense of ψηφοπαίκτης, a juggler, who causes ψῆφοι or balls to disappear (Athen. p. 19 B, etc.). Suidas gives ψηφολόγος in the same sense. Eustathius (p. 1601. 50) appears to associate that meaning with ψηφοποιός here. Cp. Lysias fr. 7 ψηφοπαικτοῦσι τὸ δίκαιον. It is very possible that Sophocles may have intended ψηφοποιός to suggest the idea of juggling, though the word could not be used as a synonym for φηφοκλέπτης, ‘juggler.’ 1190 ἀνὰ τὰν εὐρώδη Tpolav MSS. = 1197 ἰὼ πόνοι πρόγονοι πόνων. I. Like the emendation of Ahrens, ἀν τὰν εὐρώδεα Τρωΐαν, which I have adopted, there are some others which require no change in v. 1197. 1. Wecklein: 4 ἀνεμώδεα Τρωΐαν (the initial of the adj. being long, as if it were Doric for 4). Cp. Philostratus Imag. 1 Σκῦρος . . ἣν ὁ θεῖος Σοφοκλῆς ἀνεμώδεα καλεῖ (fr. 509 Nauck). This conjecture would account for the fact that a few Mss. add ἠνεμόεσσαν after Τροίαν (see cr. n.). The drawback to it is the long d, for ἠνεμώδης seems a questionable form. 2. G. Wolff: ἀν’ ἀερώδεα Τρωΐαν. ἀερώδεα is the conjecture of Hermann (see below), who took it from the scholium (on εὐρώδη), σκοτεινὴν καὶ ἀερώδη τοῖς Ἕλλησιν. But as εὐρώεις was erroneously connected εὐρύς by some of the later grammarians (see n. on 1167), so εὐρώδη might be erroneously explained by σκοτεινὴν καὶ ἀερώδη; for σκοτεινά is one of the meanings given by Hesychius to εὐρώεντα. 3 M. Seyffert: dvarov εὐρυεδεῖ Τροίᾳ. (He supposes the οι to be short. II. Emendations which involve a change in the antistrophe, v. 1197. 1. Hermann: ἀν’ alav ἀερώδεα Τρωΐαν, and in 1197 ἰὼ πόνοι, &lt;;voi πρόγονοι πόνων. 2. Dindorf: ἀν’ εὐρώδη Tpotar, and in 1197 ἰὼ πόνοι πρόπονοι.</p>

						<p type="appendix" n="173656-174139">I would gladly adopt the simple remedy (proposed by Bothe and others) of reading ναυτικοῖς θ’, but for one consideration. The sense would then be, ‘when the flames were already wrapping the extremities of the ships and the seats of the ναῦται’ (the rowers’ benches). Now I doubt whether the phrase νεῶν ἄκρα, meaning "the extremities (here the sterns) of the ships,’ is a phrase which an Attic poet would have used. (νηῶν... ἄκρα κόρυμβα in N. 9. 241 is quite another matter.) If Sophocles had meant that here, would he not have rather written rmpuraicw ? (Wecklein, who adopts the insertion of θ’, reads ναυτίλοις, comparing Aesch. Ag. 1442 ναυτίλων...σελμάτων.) On the hypothesis that ναυτικοῖς arose from ναυτικά in 1278, Bergk conjectures πευκίνοις (adding, however, &amp;, which would then be need- less) : G. Wolff, ποντίοις, or, which is less weak, παγκρατοῦς : but none of these has any probability. It may be noticed that, though Suidas and other grammarians give ‘rowers’ benches " as one meaning of ἑδώλια, that particular sense of the word does not seem to occur in classical Greek literature. The ordinary term for rowers’ benches is ζυγά : in poetry we have κληῖδες (Odyssey), and σέλματα. This circumstance, which may be accidental, could not safely be urged as an objection to taking ἑδωλίοις here as = ‘rowers’ seats.’ At the same time it should be remembered that the well-attested sense of ἑδώλια as = ‘quarter-deck ’ was derived from the primary sense of ‘seats " for passengers and other non-rowers ;—seats, presumably, of another and more comfortable kind than the rowers’ benches. The antithesis with ζυγά thus implied in that sense of ἑδώλια may help to explain why we do not, as a matter of fact, find ἑδώλια used to denote the benches of the oarsmen. One remark in conclusion. I formerly acquiesced in the view that (without inserting θ’ after ναυτικοῖς) we should explain ναυτικοῖς ἑδωλίοις as ‘the seats of the rowers.’ The decisive objection to that view, as I now think, is ἄκροισιν. It must then mean "topmost : but the rowers’ seats could be so called only relatively to the planks lining the bottom and sides of the vessel. It is not conceivable that a poet so familiar with Homer should have imagined the Homeric ship as a trireme, and ἄκροισιν, therefore, could not possibly be explained as intended to denote the benches of the θρανῖται. 1416 f. κοὐδενί πω λῴονι θνητῶν. ’ [Αἴαντος, ὅτ’ ἦν, τότε φωνῶ.] The attempts to expand v. 1416 from a paroemiac into an anapaestic dimeter have not been very felicitous. (I should prefer the insertion of δή before πω to any of them.) 1. Brunck: κοὐδενί πω λῴονι τῶν θνητῶν. 2. Erfurdt: κοὐδενὶ πώποτε λῴονι θνητῶν. 3. Hermann (formerly) : κοὐδενί γ’ ὗτινι λῴονι θνητῶν. But he afterwards preferred to leave v. 1416 untouched, and to delete v. 1417.</p>
