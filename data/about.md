# About the _Ajax_ Multi-Commentary in TEI Publisher

The [TEI Publisher](https://teipublisher.com/) version of the AjMC enables reading the project's public domain commentaries on *Ajax* in a linear fashion. It also enables searching these commentaries by default.

**NB**: The current release of the platform is work-in-progress; new features will be added in future releases and the underlying data is continuosly being improved. 

## About the project

This project explores the notion of a digital commentary by focusing on one commentary’s tradition: that of Sophocles’ *Ajax*.  In this project we focus on the historical and epistemological dimension of such publications, and study the history of this genre and of its exegetic practices. In order to enable the study of all published commentaries on the Ajax, digitized commentaries are being processed through an ad-hoc pipeline and transformed into a multi-commentary.

The project (Sept. 2020 - Aug. 2024) has been generously funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation under an Ambizione grant (no. PZ00P1_186033).
